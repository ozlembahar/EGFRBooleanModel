# Computational logical model of the EGFR signaling

This analysis introduces a two step-method used to convert an abundance of available data into useful information. 
The first section shows how experimental literature was curated and translated into logical rules for model simulations.
The second section will make sense of the diverse range of information generated by all techniques applied, including the outcome of simulations of the EGFR Boolean model, gene expression data, as well as an in vitro NSC model.
