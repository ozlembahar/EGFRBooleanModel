abstract = {Phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) and p21ras guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP) bind to and are phosphorylated by activated growth factor receptors. Both PLC gamma 1 and GAP contain two adjacent copies of the noncatalytic Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The SH2 domains of PLC gamma 1 synthesized individually in bacteria formed high affinity complexes with the epidermal growth factor (EGF)- or platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-receptors in cell lysates, and bound synergistically to activated receptors when expressed together as one bacterial protein. In vitro complex formation was dependent on prior growth factor stimulation and was competed by intracellular PLC gamma 1. Similar results were obtained for binding of GAP SH2 domains to the PDGF-receptor. The isolated SH2 domains of other signaling proteins, such as p60src and Crk, also bound activated PDGF-receptors in vitro. SH2 domains, therefore, provide a common mechanism by which enzymatically diverse regulatory proteins can physically associate with the same activated receptors and thereby couple growth factor stimulation to intracellular signal transduction pathways.},

Here, we report that a mammalian counterpart of TORC2 (mTORC2) also exists. mTORC2 contains mTOR, mLST8 and mAVO3, but not raptor. Like yeast TORC2, mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and seems to function upstream of Rho GTPases to regulate the actin cytoskeleton. mTORC2 is not upstream of the mTORC1 effector S6K.

Many experimental manipulations in cognitive neuroscience dictate paradigms with short inter trial intervals, precluding accurate baseline estimation for SCR measurements. Here, we present a novel and general approach to SCR analysis, derived from methods used in neuroimaging that estimate responses using a linear convolution model. In effect, the method obviates peak-scoring and makes use of the full SCR. We demonstrate, across three experiments, that the method has face validity in analysing reactions to a loud white noise and emotional pictures, can be generalised to paradigms where the shape of the response function is unknown and can account for parametric trial-by-trial effects. We suggest our approach provides greater flexibility in analysing SCRs than existing methods.},

abstract = {The c-mos proto-oncogene product, Mos, is a serine/threonine kinase that can activate ERK1 and 2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases by direct phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK). ERK activation is essential for oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by Mos. In this study, we examined how mitogenic and oncogenic signalling from the Mos/MEK/ERK pathway reaches the nucleus to activate downstream target genes. We show that c-Fos (the c-fos protooncogene product), which is an intrinsically unstable nuclear protein, is metabolically highly stabilized, and greatly enhances the transforming efficiency of NIH 3T3 cells, by Mos. This stabilization of c-Fos required Mos-induced phosphorylation of its C-terminal region on Ser362 and Ser374, and double replacements of these serines with acidic (Asp) residues markedly increased the stability and transforming efficiency of c-Fos even in the absence of Mos. Moreover, activation of the ERK pathway was necessary and sufficient for the c-Fos phosphorylation and stabilization by Mos. These results indicate that c-Fos undergoes stabilization, and mediates at least partly the oncogenic signalling, by the Mos/MEK/ERK pathway. The present findings also suggest that, in general, the ERK pathway may regulate the cell fate and function by affecting the metabolic stability of c-Fos.},

Intravital multiphoton imaging, confocal imaging of cryosections and biochemical analysis revealed that localization and trafficking patterns, as well as levels of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of EGFR in tumors in vivo closely resemble patterns and levels observed in the same cells treated with 20–200 pM EGF in vitro. Consistent with the prediction of low ligand concentrations in tumors, EGFR endocytosis was kinase-dependent and blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated internalization; and EGFR activity was insensitive to Cbl overexpression.

abstract = {Background: We have examined the phylogenetic pattern among eukaryotes of homologues of the E. coli 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G) repair enzymes MutY, MutM, and MutT. Results: These DNA repair enzymes are present in all large phylogenetic groups, with MutM homologues being the most universally conserved. All chordates and echinoderms were found to possess all three 8-oxo-G repair components. Likewise, the red and green algae examined have all three repair enzymes, while all land-living plants have MutY and MutM homologues, but lack MutT. However, for some phyla, e.g. protostomes, a more patchy distribution was found. Nematodes provide a striking example, where Caenorhabditis is the only identified example of an organism group having none of the three repair enzymes, while the genome of another nematode, Trichinella spiralis, instead encodes all three. The most complex distribution exists in fungi, where many different patterns of retention or loss of the three repair components are found. In addition, we found sequence insertions near or within the catalytic sites of MutY, MutM, and MutT to be present in some subgroups of Ascomycetes. Conclusion: The 8-oxo-G repair enzymes are ancient in origin, and loss of individual 8-oxo-G repair components at several distinct points in evolution appears to be the most likely explanation for the phylogenetic pattern among eukaryotes.},

We apply our methods to the regulatory network of the segment polarity genes, thus gaining novel insights into the development of gene expression patterns. For example, we show that very short synthesis and decay times can perturb the wild-type pattern. On the other hand, separation of time-scales between pre- and post-translational processes and a minimal prepattern ensure convergence to the wild-type expression pattern regardless of fluctuations. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe novel chemical compounds which selectively inhibit telomerase in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of cancer cells with these inhibitors leads to progressive telomere shortening, with no acute cytotoxicity, but a proliferation arrest after a characteristic lag period with hallmarks of senescence, including morphological, mitotic and chromosomal aberrations and altered patterns of gene expression. Telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening also result in a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of drug-treated tumour cells in a mouse xenograft model. This model was also used to demonstrate in vivo efficacy with no adverse side effects and uncomplicated oral administration of the inhibitor.

abstract = {SHP2 was recently found to down-regulate PI3K activation by dephosphorylating Gab1 but the mechanisms explaining the positive role of the Gab1/SHP2 pathway in EGF-induced Ras activation remain ill defined. Substrate trapping experiments now suggest that SHP2 dephosphorylates other Gab1 phosphotyrosines located within a central region displaying four YXXP motifs. Because these sites are potential docking motifs for Ras-GAP, we tested whether SHP2 dephosphorylates them to facilitate Ras activation. We observed that a Gab1 construct preventing SHP2 recruitment promoted membrane relocation of RasGAP. Moreover, a RasGAP-inactive mutant restored the activation of Ras in cells transfected with SHP2-inactivating Gab1 mutant or in SHP2-deficient fibroblasts, supporting the hypothesis that RasGAP is a downstream target of SHP2. To determine whether Gab1 is a RasGAP-binding partner, a Gab1 mutant deleted of four YXXP motifs was produced. The deletion suppressed RasGAP redistribution and restored the defective Ras activation caused by SHP2-inactivating mutations. Moreover, Gab1 was found to interact with RasGAP SH2 domains, only under conditions where SHP2 is not activated. To identify Ras-GAP-binding sites, Tyr to Phe mutants of Gab1 YXXP motifs were produced. Gab1 constructs mutated on Tyr(317) were severely affected in RasGAP binding and were the most active in compensating for Ras-defective activation and blocking RasGAP redistribution induced by SHP2 inactivation. We have thus localized on Gab1 a Ras-negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site involved in RasGAP binding and showed that an important SHP2 function is to down-regulate its phosphorylation to disengage RasGAP and sustain Ras activation.},

We then apply RS-1 for animal production and have achieved multifold improvement on the knock-in rates as well.

Where we are similar, this is due to the convergence of distinct evolutionary paths. I introduced the topic just now as 'the mind.' This is a contentious term to use. What is it to have a mind? One option is that we are looking for something close to what humans have-something like reflective and conscious thought. This sets a high bar for having a mind. Another possible view is that whenever organisms adapt to their circumstances in real time by adjusting their behavior, taking in information and acting in response to it, there is some degree of mentality or intelligence there. To say this sets a low bar. It is best not to set bars in either place. Roughly speaking, we are dealing with a matter of degree, though 'degree' is not quite the right term either. The evolution of a mind is the acquisition of a tool-kit for the control of behavior. The tool-kit includes some kind of perception, though different animals have very different ways of taking in information from the world. It includes some form of memory and learning, means by which past experiences can be brought to bear on the present. In some cases it includes problem-solving and planning. Some tool-kits are more elaborate and expensive than others, but they can be sophisticated in different ways, with different tools present and more investment in one technology than another. One animal might have better ways of tracking the environment through its senses, while another may have simpler senses but more sophisticated learning. Different tool kits go with different ways of making a living. The ordinary term 'mind' is},

abstract = {Similar to genomics and proteomics which yield vast amounts of data about the expression of genes and proteins, metabolomics refers to the whole metabolic profile of the cell. The focus of this report concerns the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for metabolic analyses and, in particular, its use in toxicology for examining the metabolic profile of biofluids. Examples from the literature will demonstrate how 1H NMR and pattern recognition methods are used to obtain the urinary metabolic profile, and how this profile is affected by exposure to various toxicants. These particular studies which focus on the metabolic profiles of biofluids, specifically urine, are referred to as metabonomics. NMR-based metabonomics provides a means to categorize organ-specific toxicity, monitor the onset and progression of toxicological effects, and identify biomarkers of toxicity. A future challenge, however, is to describe the cellular metabolome for purposes of understanding cellular functions (i.e., metabolomics). Thus the capabilities and advantages of multinuclear NMR to provide metabolic information in cells and tissues will also be discussed. Such information is essential if metabolomics is to provide a complementary dataset which together with genomics and proteomics can be used to construct computer network models to describe cellular functions.},

Both Gyp5p and Gyl1p interact with the N-Bin1/Amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain protein Rvs167p, but the biological function of this interaction is unclear. We show here that Gyp5p and Gyl1p recruit Rvs167p to the small-bud tip, where it plays a role in polarized exocytosis. In gyp5$\Delta$gyl1$\Delta$ cells, Rvs167p is not correctly localized to the small-bud tip. Both P473L mutation in the SH3 domain of Rvs167p and deletion of the proline-rich regions of Gyp5p and Gyl1p disrupt the interaction of Rvs167p with Gyp5p and Gyl1p and impair the localization of Rvs167p to the tips of small buds. We provide evidence for the accumulation of secretory vesicles in small buds of rvs167$\Delta$ cells and for defective Bgl2p secretion in rvs167$\Delta$ cultures enriched in small-budded cells at 13°C, implicating Rvs167p in polarized exocytosis. Moreover, both the accumulation of secretory vesicles in Rvs167p P473L cells cultured at 13°C and secretion defects in cells producing Gyp5p and Gyl1p without proline-rich regions strongly suggest that the function of Rvs167p in exocytosis depends on its ability to interact with Gyp5p and Gyl1p.},

Model calibration would be facilitated and models would increase in value were it possible to preserve links to training data along with a record of all normalization, scaling, and fusion routines used to assemble the training data from primary results. RESULTS We describe the implementation of DataRail, an open source MATLAB-based toolbox that stores experimental data in flexible multi-dimensional arrays, transforms arrays so as to maximize information content, and then constructs models using internal or external tools. Data integrity is maintained via a containment hierarchy for arrays, imposition of a metadata standard based on a newly proposed MIDAS format, assignment of semantically typed universal identifiers, and implementation of a procedure for storing the history of all transformations with the array. We illustrate the utility of DataRail by processing a newly collected set of approximately 22 000 measurements of protein activities obtained from cytokine-stimulated primary and transformed human liver cells.

abstract = {1. Recent research has addressed howtransgenic residues fromarable cropsmay influence adjacent waterways, aquatic consumers and important ecosystem processes such as litter breakdown rates. With future applications of transgenic plants in forestry, such concerns may apply to forest stream ecosystems. Before any large-scale release of geneticallymodified (GM)trees, it is therefore impera- tive to evaluate the effects of geneticmodifications in trees on such ecosystems. 2. Weconducted decomposition experiments under natural streamconditions using leaf litter from greenhouse grownGMtrees (Populus tremula {\textperiodcentered} Populus tremuloides)thatexpress Bacillus thuringi- ensis (Bt) toxins (cry3Aa; targeting coleopteran leaf-feeding beetles) to examine the hypothesis that GMtreeswould affect litter decomposition rates and⁄or the aquatic arthropod community that col- onizes and feeds on leaf litter in streams. 3. We show that two independent transformations of isogenic Populus trees to express Bt toxins caused similar changes to the composition of aquatic insects colonizing the leaf litter, ultimately manifested in a 25{\%}and 33{\%}increases in average insect abundance. 4. Measurements of 24 phenolic compounds aswell as nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in the litter did not significantly differ among modified and wild-type trees and were thus not sufficient to explain these differences in the insect assemblage. 5. Decomposition rates were comparable among litter treatments suggesting that the normal suite of leaf traits influencing decomposition was similar among litter treatments and that the shredding functions of the communityweremaintained despite the changes in insect community composition. 6. Synthesis and applications. We report that leaf litter fromGMtrees affected the composition of aquatic insect communities that colonized litter under natural stream conditions. This suggests that forest management using GM trees may affect adjacent waterways in unanticipated ways, which should be considered in future commercial applications ofGMtrees. We also argue that studies at different scales (e.g. species, communities and ecosystems) will be needed for a full understanding of the environmental effects of Bt plants.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

With this Multiplex CRISPR (CRISPRm) system, we selected an improved cellobiose utilization pathway in diploid yeast in a single round of mutagenesis and selection, which increased cellobiose fermentation rates by over ten-fold.

abstract = {Interleukin 3-dependent murine 32D cells do not detectably express members of the ErbB receptor family and do not proliferate in response to known ligands for these receptors. 32D transfectants were generated expressing human ErbB4 alone (32D.E4) or with ErbB2 (32D.E2/E4). Epidermal growth factor (EGF), neuregulin 1-beta (NRG1-beta), betacellulin (BTC), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin binding-EGF (HB-EGF), and amphiregulin were analyzed for their ability to mediate mitogenesis in these transfectants. 32D.E4 responded mitogenically to NRG1-beta and BTC. Surprisingly, EGF also induced significant DNA synthesis and TGF-alpha was negligibly mitogenic on 32D.E4 cells, whereas HB-EGF and amphiregulin were inactive. Although coexpression of ErbB2 with ErbB4 in 32D.E2/E4 cells did not significantly alter DNA synthesis in response to NRG1-beta or BTC, it greatly enhanced mitogenesis elicited by EGF and TGF-alpha and unmasked the ability of HB-EGF to induce proliferation. EGF-related ligands that exhibited potent mitogenic activity on 32D.E2/E4 cells at low concentrations induced adherence, morphological alterations, and up-regulation of the Mac-1 integrin and FcgammaRII/III at higher concentrations. While 125I-EGF could be specifically crosslinked to both 32D.E4 and 32D.E2/E4 cells, its crosslinking capacity was greatly enhanced in the cotransfected cells. The ability of the various ligands to mediate proliferation and/or adhesion in the two transfectants correlated with their capacity to induce substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and to initiate and sustain activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. We conclude that the ability of ErbB4 to mediate signal transduction through EGF-like ligands is broader than previously assumed and can be profoundly altered by the concomitant expression of ErbB2.},

Interpretation of gene expression studies using existing resources often does not lead to results that address the interrelatedness of these processes. Formal structure, such as provided by ontologies, is essential in any field for comprehensive interpretation of existing knowledge but, until now, such a structure has been lacking for adult neurogenesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have created a resource with three components 1. A structured ontology describing the key stages in the development of adult hippocampal neural stem cells into functional granule cell neurons. 2. A comprehensive survey of the literature to annotate the results of all published reports on gene function in adult hippocampal neurogenesis (257 manuscripts covering 228 genes) to the appropriate terms in our ontology. 3. An easy-to-use searchable interface to the resulting database made freely available online. The manuscript presents an overview of the database highlighting global trends such as the current bias towards research on early proliferative stages, and an example gene set enrichment analysis. A limitation of the resource is the current scope of the literature which, however, is growing by around 100 publications per year. With the ontology and database in place, new findings can be rapidly annotated and regular updates of the database will be made publicly available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The resource we present allows relevant interpretation of gene expression screens in terms of defined stages of postnatal neuronal development. Annotation of genes by hand from the adult neurogenesis literature ensures the data are directly applicable to the system under study. We believe this approach could also serve as an example to other fields in a 'bottom-up' community effort complementing the already successful 'top-down' approach of the Gene Ontology.},

GSK3 is inhibited by serine phosphorylation in response to insulin or growth factors and in vitro by either MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-1 (also known as p90rsk) or p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6k). Here we show, however, that agents which prevent the activation of both MAPKAP kinase-1 and p70S6k by insulin in vivo do not block the phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3. Another insulin-stimulated protein kinase inactivates GSK3 under these conditions, and we demonstrate that it is the product of the proto-oncogene protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt/RAC). Like the inhibition of GSK3 (refs 10, 14), the activation of PKB is prevented by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase.},

The tonoplastic water channel BobTIP1;1 (original name BobTIP26-1) genes are upregulated during dessication stress in cauliflower meristematic tissue. To investigate the physiological importance of BobTIP1;1, we expressed it in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae osmosensitive mutant fps1$\Delta$. We showed that the defect in the yeast glycerol plasma membrane transporter is complemented by a plant cDNA encoding the aquaporin BobTIP1;1 which is localized in the vacuolar membrane of the complemented yeast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a plant aquaporin for which localization in the vacuolar membrane of yeast cells is related to an osmoresistant phenotype under hypo-osmotic shock. {\textcopyright} 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Activation of mTORC1 [composed of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8. (mLST8), 40-kDa proline-rich Akt substrate (PRAS40), and DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR)] depends on the Ras-related GTPases (Rags) and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) GTPase and requires signals from amino acids, glucose, oxygen, energy (ATP), and growth factors (including cytokines and hormones such as insulin). Here we discuss the signal transduction mechanisms through which growth factor-responsive PI3K signaling activates mTORC1. We focus on how PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and spatial regulation of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) complex (TSC complex) [composed of TSC1, TSC2, and Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16-1 domain family member 7 (TBC1D7)] switches on Rheb at the lysosome, where mTORC1 is activated. Integration of PI3K- and amino acid-dependent signals upstream of mTORC1 at the lysosome is detailed in a working model. A coherent understanding of the PI3K-mTORC1 network is imperative as its dysregulation has been implicated in diverse pathologies including cancer, diabetes, autism, and aging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cells process signals using complex and dynamic networks. Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce. RESULTS Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities. CONCLUSIONS Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.},

abstract = {p53 plays a key role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have reported that the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase-Akt pathway inhibits p53-mediated transcription and apoptosis, although the underlying mechanisms have yet to be determined. Mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase for p53, plays a central role in regulation of the stability of p53 and serves as a good substrate for Akt. In this study, we find that expression of Akt reduces the protein levels of p53, at least in part by enhancing the degradation of p53. Both Akt expression and serum treatment induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186. Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser186 had little effect on the subcellular localization of Mdm2. However, both Akt expression and serum treatment increased Mdm2 ubiquitination of p53. The serum-induced increase in p53 ubiquitination was blocked by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase inhibitor. Moreover, when Ser186 was replaced by Ala, Mdm2 became resistant to Akt enhancement of p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, these results suggest that Akt enhances the ubiquitination-promoting function of Mdm2 by phosphorylation of Ser186, which results in reduction of p53 protein. This study may shed light on the mechanisms by which Akt promotes survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.},

@article{VanderGeer1995,
abstract = {Background: Signal transduction by growth factor receptor protein-tyrosine kinases is generally initiated by autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues following ligand binding. Phosphotyrosines within activated receptors form binding sites for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of cytoplasmic signalling proteins. One such protein, Shc, is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to a large number of growth factors and cytokines. Phosphorylation of Shc on tyrosine residue Y317 allows binding to the SH2 domain of Grb2, and hence stimulation of the Ras pathway. Shc is therefore implicated as an adaptor protein able to couple normal and oncogenic protein-tyrosine kinases to Ras activation. Shc itself contains an SH2 domain at its carboxyl terminus, but the function of the amino-terminal half of the protein is unknown. Results We have found that the Shc amino-terminal region binds to a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in v-src-transformed cells. This domain also bound directly to the activated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. A phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptide modeled after the Shc-binding site in polyoma middle T antigen (LLSNPTpYSVMRSK) was able to compete efficiently with the activated EGF receptor for binding to the Shc amino terminus. This competition was dependent on phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the peptide, and was abrogated by deletion of the leucine residue at position -5. The Shc amino-terminal domain also bound to the autophosphorylated nerve growth factor receptor (Trk), but bound significantly less well to a mutant receptor in which tyrosine Y490 in the receptor's Shc-binding site had been substituted by phenylalanine. Conclusion These data implicate the amino-terminal region of Shc in binding to activated receptors and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Binding appears to be specific for phosphorylated tyrosine residues within the sequence NPXpY, which is conserved in many Shc-binding sites. The Shc amino-terminal region bears only very limited sequence identity to known SH2 domains, suggesting that it represents a new class of phosphotyrosine-binding modules. Consistent with this view, the amino-terminal Shc domain is highly conserved in a Drosophila Shc homologue. Binding of Shc to activated receptors through its amino terminus could leave the carboxy-terminal SH2 domain free for other interactions. In this way, Shc may function as an adaptor protein to bring two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins together. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Next-generation-sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the field of genome assembly because of its much higher data throughput and much lower cost compared with traditional Sanger sequencing. However, NGS poses new computational challenges to de novo genome assembly. Among the challenges, GC bias in NGS data is known to aggravate genome assembly. However, it is not clear to what extent GC bias affects genome assembly in general. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis on the effects of GC bias on genome assembly. Our analyses reveal that GC bias only lowers assembly completeness when the degree of GC bias is above a threshold. At a strong GC bias, the assembly fragmentation due to GC bias can be explained by the low coverage of reads in the GC-poor or GC-rich regions of a genome. This effect is observed for all the assemblers under study. Increasing the total amount of NGS data thus rescues the assembly fragmentation because of GC bias. However, the amount of data needed for a full rescue depends on the distribution of GC contents. Both low and high coverage depths due to GC bias lower the accuracy of assembly. These pieces of information provide guidance toward a better de novo genome assembly in the presence of GC bias.},

abstract = {Expression of the Drosophila segment polarity genes is initiated by a pre-pattern of pair-rule gene products and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions throughout several stages of embryonic development. Analysis of a model of gene interactions based on differential equations showed that wild-type expression patterns of these genes can be obtained for a wide range of kinetic parameters, which suggests that the steady states are determined by the topology of the network and the type of regulatory interactions between components, not the detailed form of the rate laws. To investigate this, we propose and analyse a Boolean model of this network which is based on a binary ON/OFF representation of mRNA and protein levels, and in which the interactions are formulated as logical functions. In this model the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression are determined by the topology of the network and whether components are present or absent, rather than the absolute levels of the mRNAs and proteins and the functional details of their interactions. The model is able to reproduce the wild-type gene expression patterns, as well as the ectopic expression patterns observed in overexpression experiments and various mutants. Furthermore, we compute explicitly all steady states of the network and identify the basin of attraction of each steady state. The model gives important insights into the functioning of the segment polarity gene network, such as the crucial role of the wingless and sloppy paired genes, and the network's ability to correct errors in the pre-pattern. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In its simplest form, SGA consists of a series of replica pinning steps that enable construction of haploid double mutants through automated mating and meiotic recombination. Using this method, a strain carrying a query mutation, such as a deletion allele of a nonessential gene or a conditional temperature-sensitive allele of an essential gene, can be crossed to an input array of yeast mutants, such as the complete set of approximately 5000 viable deletion mutants. The resulting output array of double mutants can be scored for genetic interactions based on estimates of cellular fitness derived from colony-size measurements. The SGA score method can be used to analyze large-scale data sets, whereas small-scale data sets can be analyzed using SGAtools, a simple web-based interface that includes all the necessary analysis steps for quantifying genetic interactions.},

In this study, the decomposition of leaf litter from transgenic birch trees (Betula pendula) expressing sugar beet chitinase IV gene was studied in a field experiment. Eight chitinase transgenic lines and a non-transgenic control were included in the study. The decomposition of these litters was investigated by studying: (i) litter mass loss, (ii) fungal (litter ergosterol content) and total microbial biomass (SIR) and their activity (basal respiration), and (iii) the effects of transgenic litter on microbial-feeding soil fauna (number of nematodes and abundance of different functional groups). At the end of the study (8 and 11 months after establishment) mass loss of chitinase transgenic leaf litter did not differ from that of non-transgenic control trees. Similarly, no differences in either the fungal or total microbial biomass between the treatments were recorded. A single transgenic line showing high chitinase IV expression differed significantly from the controls in the mean number of nematodes. The nematode populations in this litter showed distinct temporal dynamics compared to the controls, thus indirectly indicating microbial differences in the litter. The results of this study indicate that conceivable changes, possibly derived from pleiotropic effects due to gene modification, in the litter quality due to gene transformation are either absent or too weak to affect the decomposability of the litter in the soil. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Ultimately, we expect that such information will change how we think about biological systems in a fundamental way. Instead of viewing the genetic parts list of an organism as a loose collection of biochemical activities, in the best case, we anticipate discrete networks of function to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype, and to do so in a more profound way than the current qualitative classification of linked reactions into familiar pathways, such as glycolysis and the MAPK signal transduction cascades. At the present time, however, we are still far from a complete answer to the most basic question: what can we learn about biology by studying networks? Promising steps in this direction have come from such diverse approaches as mathematical analysis of global network structure, partitioning networks into functionally related modules and motifs, and even de novo design of networks. A complete picture will probably require integrating the data obtained from all of these approaches with modeling efforts at many different levels of detail.},

Here we introduce Qualitative networks, an extension of Boolean networks. With this framework, we use formal verification methods to check whether a model is consistent with the laboratory experimental observations on which it is based. If the model does not conform to the data, we suggest a revised model and the new hypotheses are tested in-silico.RESULTS:We consider networks in which elements range over a small finite domain allowing more flexibility than Boolean values, and add target functions that allow to model a rich set of behaviors. We propose a symbolic algorithm for analyzing the steady state of these networks, allowing us to scale up to a system consisting of 144 elements and state spaces of approximately 1086 states. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through a model of the interaction between the Notch and the Wnt signaling pathways in mammalian skin, and its extensive analysis.CONCLUSION:We introduce an approach for constructing computational models of biological systems that extends the framework of Boolean networks and uses formal verification methods for the analysis of the model. This approach can scale to multicellular models of complex pathways, and is therefore a useful tool for the analysis of complex biological systems. The hypotheses formulated during in-silico testing suggest new avenues to explore experimentally. Hence, this approach has the potential to efficiently complement experimental studies in biology},

We show that the order of the LSm proteins within the ring is consistent with the order of the related SmE, SmF, and SmG proteins in the heptameric Sm ring. Nonetheless, differences in RNA binding pockets prevent the prediction of the nucleotide binding preferences of the LSm complexes. Using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, we confirm that LSm5, LSm6, and LSm7 also assemble into a 60-kDa hexameric ring in solution. With a combination of pull-down and NMR experiments, we show that the LSm657 complex can incorporate LSm23 in order to assemble further towards native LSm rings. Interestingly, we find that the NMR spectra of the LSm57, LSm657-657, and LSm23-657 complexes differ significantly, suggesting that the angles between the LSm building blocks change depending on the ring size of the complex. In summary, our results identify LSm657 as a plastic and functional building block on the assembly route towards the LSm1-7 and LSm2-8 complexes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

PKB is a direct target of these lipids, but this regulation is complex. The lipids can bind to the pleckstrin homologous domain of PKB, causing its translocation to the membrane, and also enable upstream, Thr308-directed kinases to phosphorylate and activate PKB. Four isoforms of these PKB kinases were purified from sheep brain. They bound PtdIns(3,4,5)P3and associated with lipid vesicles containing it. These kinases contain an NH2-terminal catalytic domain and a COOH-terminal pleckstrin homologous domain, and their heterologous expression augments receptor activation of PKB, which suggests they are the primary signal transducers that enable PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns- (3,4)P2 to activate PKB and hence to control signaling pathways regulating cell survival, glucose uptake, and glycogen metabolism.},

abstract = {The EGF Receptor (EGFR), the first transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase cloned and sequenced, and its closely related family members HER2, HER3, and HER4, play myriad roles in mammalian growth and development. Receptor activation involves ligand binding to separate receptors followed by formation of active dimers. These receptors can signal as homodimers or they can subtly alter signaling output by heterodimerizing with other family members. Adding complexity, these receptors with varying specificity bind at least 10 ligands from two ligand families, the EGF and neuregulin/heregulin families. This signaling system's impact on human neoplasia is underscored by the following: i.) EGFR is overexpressed or activated by autocrine or paracrine growth factor loops in at least 50{\%} of epithelial malignancies; ii.) HER2 is amplified and dramatically overexpressed in approximately 20{\%}-25{\%} or breast cancers; iii) HER3 and HER4 are variably expressed in breast and other cancers. Overexpression and/or activation of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 has been correlated with poor tumor prognosis; antibody and small molecule inhibitors of their activity are being tested as therapy in cancer patients. However, the signaling complexity engendered by four interacting receptors and ten ligands makes it difficult to definitively measure receptor signaling output in human tumors and even makes mechanistic studies of the family's role in normal physiology and neoplastic transformation a challenge. In spite of the literature's emphasis on growth control, activation by some EGF receptor family member ligands can produce tumor cell differentiation, characterized by growth cessation and differentiation gene product synthesis. The present work delineates a role for HER4 in breast cancer cell differentiation and demonstrates that HER4 is both necessary and sufficient to produce an anti-proliferative signal. These},

abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

abstract = {Our recent work has shown that activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway extends the half-life of the Myc protein and thus enhances the accumulation of Myc activity. We have extended these observations by investigating two N-terminal phosphorylation sites in Myc, Thr 58 and Ser 62, which are known to be regulated by mitogen stimulation. We now show that the phosphorylation of these two residues is critical for determining the stability of Myc. Phosphorylation of Ser 62 is required for Ras-induced stabilization of Myc, likely mediated through the action of ERK. Conversely, phosphorylation of Thr 58, likely mediated by GSK-3 but dependent on the prior phosphorylation of Ser 62, is associated with degradation of Myc. Further analysis demonstrates that the Ras-dependent PI-3K pathway is also critical for controlling Myc protein accumulation, likely through the control of GSK-3 activity. These observations thus define a synergistic role for multiple Ras-mediated phosphorylation pathways in the control of Myc protein accumulation during the initial stage of cell proliferation.},

We present SHRAP (SHort Read Assembly Protocol), a sequencing protocol and assembly methodology that utilizes high-throughput short-read technologies. We describe a variation on hierarchical sequencing with two crucial differences: (1) we select a clone library from the genome randomly rather than as a tiling path and (2) we sample clones from the genome at high coverage and reads from the clones at low coverage. We assume that 200 bp read lengths with a 1{\%} error rate and inexpensive random fragment cloning on whole mammalian genomes is feasible. Our assembly methodology is based on first ordering the clones and subsequently performing read assembly in three stages: (1) local assemblies of regions significantly smaller than a clone size, (2) clone-sized assemblies of the results of stage 1, and (3) chromosome-sized assemblies. By aggressively localizing the assembly problem during the first stage, our method succeeds in assembling short, unpaired reads sampled from repetitive genomes. We tested our assembler using simulated reads from D. melanogaster and human chromosomes 1, 11, and 21, and produced assemblies with large sets of contiguous sequence and a misassembly rate comparable to other draft assemblies. Tested on D. melanogaster and the entire human genome, our clone-ordering method produces accurate maps, thereby localizing fragment assembly and enabling the parallelization of the subsequent steps of our pipeline. Thus, we have demonstrated that truly inexpensive de novo sequencing of mammalian genomes will soon be possible with high-throughput, short-read technologies using our methodology.},

Within this pathway, Rac is a key downstream target/effector of PI3K. However, how the signal is routed from PI3K to Rac is unclear. One possible candidate for this function is the Rac-activating complex Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1, which possesses Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity. Here, we show that Abi1 (also known as E3b1) recruits PI3K, via p85, into a multimolecular signaling complex that includes Eps8 and Sos-1. The recruit-ment of p85 to the Eps8–Abi1–Sos-1 complex and phos-C phatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 phosphate (PIP3), the catalytic product of PI3K, concur to unmask its Rac-GEF activity in vitro. Moreover, they are indispensable for the activation of Rac and Rac-dependent actin remodeling in vivo. On growth factor stimulation, endogenous p85 and Abi1 consistently colocalize into membrane ruffles, and cells lacking p85 fail to support Abi1-dependent Rac activation. Our results define a mechanism whereby propagation of signals, originating from RTKs or Ras and leading to actin reorgani-zation, is controlled by direct physical interaction between PI3K and a Rac-specific GEF complex.},

We describe novel chemical compounds which selectively inhibit telomerase in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of cancer cells with these inhibitors leads to progressive telomere shortening, with no acute cytotoxicity, but a proliferation arrest after a characteristic lag period with hallmarks of senescence, including morphological, mitotic and chromosomal aberrations and altered patterns of gene expression. Telomerase inhibition and telomere shortening also result in a marked reduction of the tumorigenic potential of drug-treated tumour cells in a mouse xenograft model. This model was also used to demonstrate in vivo efficacy with no adverse side effects and uncomplicated oral administration of the inhibitor.

A typical example is the case where it is necessary to estimate the activity of a transcription factor (which is often not directly measurable) from the expression of its target genes. We present here ROMA (Representation and quantification Of Module Activities) Java software, designed for fast and robust computation of the activity of gene sets (or modules) with coordinated expression. ROMA activity quantification is based on the simplest uni-factor linear model of gene regulation that approximates the expression data of a gene set by its first principal component. The proposed algorithm implements novel functionalities: it provides several method modifications for principal components computation, including weighted, robust and centered methods; it distinguishes overdispersed modules (based on the variance explained by the first principal component) and coordinated modules (based on the significance of the spectral gap); finally, it computes statistical significance of the estimated module overdispersion or coordination. ROMA can be applied in many contexts, from estimating differential activities of transcriptional factors to finding overdispersed pathways in single-cell transcriptomics data. We describe here the principles of ROMA providing several practical examples of its use. ROMA source code is available at https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Roma.},

Analysis of off-target binding sites showed the importance of the PAM-proximal region of the sgRNA guiding sequence and that dCas9 binding sites are enriched in open chromatin regions. When targeted with catalytically active Cas9, some off-target binding sites had indels above background levels in a region around the ChIP-seq peak, but generally at lower rates than the on-target sites. Our results elucidate major determinants of Cas9 targeting, and we show that ChIP-seq allows unbiased detection of Cas9 binding sites genome-wide.},

abstract = {Genetic interactions occur when mutant alleles of two or more genes collaborate to generate an unusual composite phenotype, one that would not be predicted based on the expected combined effects of the individual mutant alleles. Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) methodology was developed to automate yeast genetic analysis and enable systematic genetic interaction studies. In its simplest form, SGA consists of a series of replica pinning steps, which enable the construction of haploid double mutants through mating and meiotic recombination. For example, a strain carrying a query mutation, such as a deletion allele of a nonessential gene or a conditional temperature sensitive allele of an essential gene, could be crossed to an input array of yeast mutants, such as the complete set of {\~{}}5,000 viable deletion mutants, to generate an output array of double mutants, that can be scored for genetic interactions based on estimates of cellular fitness derived from colony-size measurements. A simple quantitative measure of genetic interactions can be derived from colony size, which serves as a proxy for fitness. Furthermore, SGA can be applied in a variety of other contexts, such as Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL), in which a query mutation is crossed into an array of yeast strains, each of which overexpresses a different gene, thus making use of SGA to probe for gain-of-function phenotypes in specific genetic backgrounds. High-Content Screening (HCS) also integrates SGA to perform genome-wide screens for quantitative analysis of morphological phenotypes or pathway activity based upon fluorescent markers, extending genetic interaction analysis beyond fitness-based measurements. Genetic interaction studies offer insight into gene function, pathway structure, and buffering, and thus a complete genetic interaction network of yeast will generate a global functional wiring diagram for a eukaryotic cell.},

We find that SpCas9 tolerates mismatches between guide RNA and target DNA at different positions in a sequence-dependent manner, sensitive to the number, position and distribution of mismatches. We also show that SpCas9-mediated cleavage is unaffected by DNA methylation and that the dosage of SpCas9 and sgRNA can be titrated to minimize off-target modification.

abstract = {RNA decapping is an important contributor to gene expression and is a critical determinant of mRNA decay. The recent demonstration that mammalian cells harbor at least two distinct decapping enzymes that preferentially modulate a subset of mRNAs raises the intriguing possibility of whether additional decapping enzymes exist. Because both known decapping proteins, Dcp2 and Nudt16, are members of the Nudix hydrolase family, we set out to determine whether other members of this family of proteins also contain intrinsic RNA decapping activity. Here we demonstrate that six additional mouse Nudix proteins--Nudt2, Nudt3, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, and Nudt19--have varying degrees of decapping activity in vitro on both monomethylated and unmethylated capped RNAs. The decapping products from Nudt17 and Nudt19 were analogous to Dcp2 and predominantly generated m⁷GDP, while cleavage by Nudt2, Nudt3, Nudt12, and Nudt15 was more pleiotropic and generated both m⁷GMP and m⁷GDP. Interestingly, all six Nudix proteins as well as both Dcp2 and Nudt16 could hydrolyze the cap of an unmethylated capped RNA, indicating that decapping enzymes may be less constrained for the presence of the methyl moiety. Investigation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Nudix proteins revealed that the yeast homolog of Nudt3, Ddp1p, also possesses decapping activity in vitro. Moreover, the bacterial Nudix pyrophosphohydrolase RppH displayed RNA decapping activity and released m⁷GDP product comparable to Dcp2, indicating that decapping is an evolutionarily conserved activity that preceded mammalian cap formation. These findings demonstrate that multiple Nudix family hydrolases may function in mRNA decapping and mRNA stability.},

For example, in allergy a module was used to find a novel candidate gene that was validated by functional and clinical studies. Such analyses play important roles in systems medicine. This is an emerging discipline that aims to gain a translational understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying common diseases.

The MAPKs coordinately regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival, which are functions also known to be mediated by members of a growing family of MAPK-activated protein kinases (MKs; formerly known as MAPKAP kinases). The MKs are related serine/threonine kinases that respond to mitogenic and stress stimuli through proline-directed phosphorylation and activation of the kinase domain by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and p38 MAPKs. There are currently 11 vertebrate MKs in five subfamilies based on primary sequence homology: the ribosomal S6 kinases, the mitogen- and stress-activated kinases, the MAPK-interacting kinases, MAPK-activated protein kinases 2 and 3, and MK5. In the last 5 years, several MK substrates have been identified, which has helped tremendously to identify the biological role of the members of this family. Together with data from the study of MK-knockout mice, the identities of the MK substrates indicate that they play important roles in diverse biological processes, including mRNA translation, cell proliferation and survival, and the nuclear genomic response to mitogens and cellular stresses. In this article, we review the existing data on the MKs and discuss their physiological functions based on recent discoveries.},

Here, we show that hamartin and tuberin function together to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated signaling to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). First, coexpression of hamartin and tuberin repressed phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, resulting in increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E; importantly, a mutant of TSC2 derived from TSC patients was defective in repressing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. Second, the activity of S6K1 was repressed by coexpression of hamartin and tuberin, but the activity of rapamycin-resistant mutants of S6K1 were not affected, implicating mTOR in the TSC-mediated inhibitory effect on S6K1. Third, hamartin and tuberin blocked the ability of amino acids to activate S6K1 within nutrient-deprived cells, a process that is dependent on mTOR. These findings strongly implicate the tuberin-hamartin tumor suppressor complex as an inhibitor of mTOR and suggest that the formation of tumors within TSC patients may result from aberrantly high levels of mTOR-mediated signaling to downstream targets. mTOR,mammalian target of rapamycin;TSC,tuberous sclerosis complex;PI3K,phosphoinositide-3-kinase;S6K1,ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1;4E-BP1,eIF4E-binding protein;HEK,human embryonic kidney;HA,hemagglutinin},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more.Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

abstract = {The FKHR gene was first identified from its disruption by the t(2;13) chromosomal translocation seen in the pediatric tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. It encodes for a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Recently, a homolog of FKHR in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was identified called DAF-16, which is a downstream target of two Akt homologs in an insulin-related signaling pathway. We have examined the possible role of Akt in the regulation of FKHR. We find that FKHR can bind in vitro to the insulin-responsive sequence (IRS) in the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 promoter and can activate transcription from a reporter plasmid containing multiple copies of the IRS. Expression of active but not inactive Akt can suppress FKHR-mediated transcriptional activation. Akt can phosphorylate FKHR in vitro on three phosphoacceptor sites, at least a subset of which can also be phosphorylated by Akt in vivo. Importantly, mutation of these three sites to alanine residues enhances the transcriptional activity of FKHR and renders it resistant to inhibition by Akt. Expression of an Akt-resistant mutant of FKHR causes apoptosis in 293T cells in a manner dependent on DNA binding. These results suggest that FKHR may be a direct nuclear regulatory target for Akt in both metabolic and cell survival pathways.},

abstract = {RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms. RGENs are ribonucleoproteins that consist of guide RNA and Cas9, a protein component originated from Streptococcus pyogenes. These enzymes cleave chromosomal DNA, whose sequence is complementary, to guide RNA in a targeted manner, producing site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the repair of which gives rise to targeted genome modifications. Despite broad interest in RGEN-mediated genome editing, these nucleases are limited by off-target mutations and unwanted chromosomal translocations associated with off-target DNA cleavages. Here, we show that off-target effects of RGENs can be reduced below the detection limits of deep sequencing by choosing unique target sequences in the genome and modifying both guide RNA and Cas9. We found that both the composition and structure of guide RNA can affect RGEN activities in cells to reduce off-target effects. RGENs efficiently discriminated on-target sites from off-target sites that differ by two bases. Furthermore, exome sequencing analysis showed that no off-target mutations were induced by two RGENs in four clonal populations of mutant cells. In addition, paired Cas9 nickases, composed of D10A Cas9 and guide RNA, which generate two single-strand breaks (SSBs) or nicks on different DNA strands, were highly specific in human cells, avoiding off-target mutations without sacrificing genome-editing efficiency. Interestingly, paired nickases induced chromosomal deletions in a targeted manner without causing unwanted translocations. Our results highlight the importance of choosing unique target sequences and optimizing guide RNA and Cas9 to avoid or reduce RGEN-induced off-target mutations.},

abstract = {Protein kinase C (PKC), a phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase, appears to be involved in the signal transduction response to many hormones and growth factors; there are 11 different PKC isozymes. Because PKC isozymes directly and/or indirectly participate in signal transduction pathways of normal and transformed cells through phosphorylation of target proteins, it is critical to understand the diversity of the intracellular signaling pathways regulated by each PKC isozyme. Thus, PKC isozyme-specific substrates are useful to understand the characterization of the intracellular signaling pathways for each PKC isozyme. Consensus sequences and sequence information obtained from PKC target proteins are very important to design PKC isozyme-specific peptide substrates. Moreover, computational prediction programs of phosphorylation sites using a library of peptide substrates aid in the fast design of PKC isozyme-specific peptide substrates. Although a large number of target proteins and synthetic peptides for PKCs are known, only two peptide substrates (peptide 422-426 of murine elongation factor-1$\alpha$ and Alphatomega peptide) have been reported as PKC isozyme-specific peptide substrates. This discussion will review the literature concerning these native and synthetic PKC isozyme-specific peptide substrates and their design. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The complexity of most natural ecosystems has precluded detailed studies of virus-host interactions.

Viruses were matched to their hosts by analyzing spacer sequences that occur among clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) that are a hallmark of virus resistance. Virus population genomic analyses provided evidence that extensive recombination shuffles sequence motifs sufficiently to evade CRISPR spacers. Only the most recently acquired spacers match coexisting viruses, which suggests that community stability is achieved by rapid but compensatory shifts in host resistance levels and virus population structure.},

Here we describe a novel set of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that interact with each other and with U6 snRNA. Seven Lsm proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the previously characterized Lsm4p (Uss1p) and interact with each other in two-hybrid analyses. Free U6 and U4/U6 duplexed RNAs co-immunoprecipitate with seven of the Lsm proteins that are essential for the stable accumulation of U6 snRNA. Analyses of U4/U6 di-snRNPs and U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNPs in Lsm-depleted strains suggest that Lsm proteins may play a role in facilitating conformational rearrangements of the U6 snRNP in the association-dissociation cycle of spliceosome complexes. Thus, Lsm proteins form a complex that differs from the canonical Sm complex in its RNA association(s) and function. We discuss the possible existence and functions of alternative Lsm complexes, including the likelihood that they are involved in processes other than pre-mRNA splicing.},

Group fusion involves combining the results of similarity searches based on multiple reference structures and a single similarity measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to screening, and also describe an approximate form of group fusion, turbo similarity searching, that can be used when just a single reference structure is available. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we have cloned the human cyclin D1 gene and analysed the structure and function of 3kb of its 5'-flanking region. Several regulatory regions involved in both basal level and serum-induced expression were identified, two of which turned out to be of particular interest. One of these regions is involved in serum induction and is located 848-944 bp upstream of the initiation site. In agreement with this result, in vivo footprinting revealed a novel, strongly inducible protein binding site around positions -928 to -921. A second constitutively occupied binding site was mapped to a potential CRE at position -52. Cotransfection experiments showed that the cyclin D1 promoter is inducible by c-Jun, and that this induction is mediated predominantly through the protected putative CRE at -52.},

abstract = {Synthetic Biology offers qualitatively new perspectives on the benefits of industrially harnessed biological processes. The ability to modify and reprogramme natural biology increases the scope of tailored bioprocesses and yields attractive prospects beyond conventional Biotechnology. The present review summarises the major achievements and categorises them according to a hierarchy of system levels. Similar structures are known in the engineering sciences and might prove useful for the future development of Synthetic Biology. The hierarchy encompasses several levels of detail. Biological (macro-)molecules present the most detailed level (parts), followed by compartmentalised or non-compartmentalised modules (devices). In the next level, parts and devices are combined into functional cells and further into cellular communities. The manifold interactions between biological entities of the same hierarchical level or between different levels are accounted for by networks, primarily metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits. Networks of different types are represented as a superordinate hierarchical level that achieves full system integration. On all these levels, extensive and sound scientific foundations exist regarding experimental but also theoretical methods. These have led to diverse manifestations of Synthetic Biology on the parts and devices levels. Investigations involving synthetic components on the systems scale represent the most difficult and remain limited in number. A main challenge lies with the quantitative prediction of interactions between different entities across different scales. Systems-theoretical approaches provide important tools to analyse complex biological behaviour and can support the design of artificial biological systems. A promising strategy is seen in an efficient modularisation that reduces biological systems to a limited set of functional modules with well-characterised interfaces. For the design of synthetic biological systems the interactions across these interfaces should be standardised to reduce complexity. Yet, the identification of modules and standardised interaction routes remains a non-trivial problem. Furthermore, an appropriate platform that efficiently describes replication and evolutionary processes has to be developed in order to extend the achievements of Synthetic Biology into designed biological processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

During angiogenesis, cellular processes are tightly coordinated by signaling molecules and their receptors. Understanding how endothelial cells synthesize multiple biochemical signals can catalyze the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat cancer. This study is the first to propose a signal transduction model highlighting the cross-talk between key receptors involved in angiogenesis, namely the VEGF, integrin, and cadherin receptors. From experimental data, we construct a network model of receptor cross-talk and analyze its dynamics. We identify relationships between receptor activation combinations and cellular function, and show that cross-talk is crucial to phenotype determination. The network converges to a unique set of output states that correspond to known cell phenotypes: migratory, proliferating, quiescent, apoptotic, and it predicts one phenotype that challenges the "go or grow" hypothesis. Finally, we use the model to study protein inhibition and to suggest molecular targets for anti-angiogenic therapies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Using this approach, we compared strategies for enhancing CRISPR-mediated HDR, focusing on known genes and small molecules that impact non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Ultimately, we identified the small molecule RS-1 as a potent enhancer of CRISPR-based genome editing, enhancing HDR 3- to 6-fold depending on the locus and transfection method. We also characterized U2OS human osteosarcoma cells expressing Clover-tagged PML and demonstrate that this strategy generates cell lines with PML NBs that are structurally and functionally similar to bodies in the parental cell line. Thus, the nuclear domain knock-in screen that we describe provides a simple means of rapidly evaluating methods and small molecules that have the potential to enhance Cas9-mediated HDR.},

Some superfamily members, such as Escherichia coli MicrotT, have the ability to degrade potentially mutagenic, oxidised nucleotides while others control the levels of metabolic intermediates and signalling compounds. In prokaryotes and simple eukaryo tes, the number of Nudix genes varies from 0 to over 30, reflecting the metabolic complexity and adaptability of the organism. Mammals have around 24 Nudix genes, several of which encode more than one variant. This review integrates the sizeable recent literature on these proteins with information from global functional genomic studies to provide some insights into the possible roles of different superfamily members in cellular metabolism and homeostasis and to stimulate discussion and further research into this ubiquitous protein family.},

The behavioral patterns of individual animals affect their respective role in the ecosystem and their prospects for survival. Even though some of the factors shaping individuality have been identified, the mechanisms underlying individuation are poorly understood and are generally considered to be genetics-based. Here we devised a large environment where mice live continuously, and observed that individuality, measured by both social and individual traits, emerged and settled within the group. Midbrain dopamine neurons underwent neurophysiological adaptations that mirrored this phenotypic divergence in individual behaviors. Strikingly, modifying the social environment resulted in a fast re-adaptation of both the animal's personality and its dopaminergic signature. These results indicate that individuality can rapidly evolve upon social challenges, and does not just depend on the genetic or epigenetic initial status of the animal.},

These analogue enzymes were further studied by X-ray crystallography, NMR relaxation, and pulse-EPR methods, in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Tyrosine kinase oncoproteins cause simultaneous activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways. However, the precise mechanisms by which individual pathways induce oncogenesis are not well understood. We have investigated the roles of individual signaling pathways in v-Src-dependent cell growth and survival by inhibiting one particular pathway. v-Src induced constitutive activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ras in murine Ba/F3 cells and led to factor-independent proliferation. Dominant-negative mutants of STAT3 (STAT3D) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Deltap85) inhibited v-Src-dependent growth by approximately 60 and approximately 40{\%}, respectively. Moreover, dominant-negative Ras (N17) induced severe apoptosis, which was accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspase-3. Although cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or caspase-3 inhibitors remained viable even when N17 was expressed, the growth was reduced by approximately 85{\%}. During N17- and STAT3D-induced growth suppression, expression of cyclin D2, cyclin D3, c-myc, and c-fos was suppressed by N17, whereas that of cyclin D2, cyclin E, and c-myc was suppressed by STAT3D. Thus, v-Src-activated Ras and STAT3 are involved in distinct but partly overlapping transcriptional regulation of cell cycle regulatory molecules. These results suggest that the full oncogenic activity of v-Src requires simultaneous activation of multiple signalings, in which Ras is particularly required for survival.},

abstract = {We have analyzed ErbB receptor interplay induced by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptides in cell lines naturally expressing the four ErbB receptors. Down-regulation of cell surface ErbB-1 or ErbB-2 by intracellular expression of specific antibodies has allowed us to delineate the role of these receptors during signaling elicited by: EGF and heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF), ligands of ErbB-1; betacellulin (BTC), a ligand of ErbB-1 and ErbB-4; and neu differentiation factor (NDF), a ligand of ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. Ligand-induced ErbB receptor heterodimerization follows a strict hierarchy and ErbB-2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner of all ErbB proteins. NDF-activated ErbB-3 or ErbB-4 heterodimerize with ErbB-1 only when no ErbB-2 is available. If all ErbB receptors are present, NDF receptors preferentially dimerize with ErbB-2. Furthermore, EGF- and BTC-induced activation of ErbB-3 is impaired in the absence of ErbB-2, suggesting that ErbB-2 has a role in the lateral transmission of signals between other ErbB receptors. Finally, ErbB-1 activated by all EGF-related peptides (EGF, HB-EGF, BTC and NDF) couples to SHC, whereas only ErbB-1 activated by its own ligands associates with and phosphorylates Cbl. These results provide the first biochemical evidence that a given ErbB receptor has distinct signaling properties depending on its dimerization.},

The mRNA level of 186 genes increased at least 3-fold after a shift to NaCl or sorbitol, whereas that of more than 100 genes was at least 1.5-fold diminished. Many induced genes encode proteins that presumably contribute to protection against different types of damage or encode enzymes in glycerol, trehalose, and glycogen metabolism. Several genes, which encode poorly expressed isoforms of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, were induced. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is required for full induction of many but not all genes. The recently characterized Hot1p transcription factor is required for normal expression of a subset of the HOG pathway-dependent responses. Stimulated expression of the genes that required the general stress-response transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p was also reduced in a hog1 mutant, suggesting that Msn2p/Msn4p might be regulated by the HOG pathway. The expression of genes that are known to be controlled by the mating pheromone response pathway was stimulated by osmotic shock specifically in a hog1 mutant. Inappropriate activation of the mating response may contribute to the growth defect of a hog1 mutant in high osmolarity medium.},

abstract = {A genetic interaction occurs when the combination of two mutations leads to an unexpected phenotype. Screens for synthetic genetic interactions have been used extensively to identify genes whose products are functionally related. In particular, synthetic lethal genetic interactions often identify genes that buffer one another or impinge on the same essential pathway. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of ∼5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing ∼80{\%} of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This approach can be extended to all ∼6000 genes through the use of yeast arrays containing mutants carrying conditional or hypomorphic alleles of essential genes. Estimating the fitness for the two single mutants and their corresponding double mutant enables a quantitative measurement of genetic interactions, distinguishing negative (synthetic lethal) and positive (within pathway and suppression) interactions. The profile of genetic interactions represents a rich phenotypic signature for each gene and clustering genetic interaction profiles group genes into functionally relevant pathways and complexes. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different genetic screens or combined with high-content screening systems to quantify the activity of specific reporters in genome-wide sets of single or more complex multiple mutant backgrounds. Comparison of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction profiles offers the potential to link bioactive compounds to their targets. Finally, we also developed an SGA system for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, providing another model system for comparative analysis of genetic networks and testing the conservation of genetic networks over millions of years of evolution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {To assess the functional significance of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor at Thr654, we compared the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA) on ligand-induced internalization and down-regulation between wild-type and mutant receptors that contain an alanine substitution at position 654. Activation of protein kinase C with TPA blocked EGF-induced internalization and down-regulation of Thr654 receptors and inhibited in vivo tyrosine kinase activity by 80{\%}. TPA did not inhibit transferrin receptor internalization or constitutive EGF receptor internalization, suggesting that protein kinase C activation inhibits only the ligand-induced process. Inhibition by TPA of induced internalization, down-regulation, and kinase activity required threonine at position 654 since full-length Ala654 EGF receptors were significantly resistant to TPA inhibition of these ligand-induced activities. However, C'-terminal truncation further enhanced this resistance to TPA inhibition. The EGF-dependent internalization of kinase-inactive receptors truncated at residue 1022 was also impaired by TPA in Thr654 receptors, but not in Ala654 receptors, indicating that phosphorylation at Thr654 also interferes with tyrosine kinase-independent receptor activities. We conclude that the dominant regulatory effect of protein kinase C on the EGF receptor is mediated through phosphorylation at Thr654 which effectively inactivates the receptor. The submembrane region of the EGF receptor appears to regulate transmission of conformational information from the extracellular ligand-binding site to the cytoplasmic kinase and regulatory domains.},

A complex of seven Sm-like proteins, Lsm2-Lsm8, also binds the 3' end of U6 snRNA. A mutation within the Sm motif of Lsm8p causes Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells to require the La protein Lhp1p to stabilize nascent U6 snRNA. Here we describe functional interactions between Lhp1p, the Lsm proteins, and U6 snRNA. LSM2 and LSM4, but not other LSM genes, act as allele-specific, low-copy suppressors of mutations in Lsm8p. Overexpression of LSM2 in the lsm8 mutant strain increases the levels of both Lsm8p and U6 snRNPs. In the presence of extra U6 snRNA genes, LSM8 becomes dispensable for growth, suggesting that the only essential function of LSM8 is in U6 RNA biogenesis or function. Furthermore, deletions of LSM5, LSM6, or LSM7 cause LHP1 to become required for growth. Our experiments are consistent with a model in which Lsm2p and Lsm4p contact Lsm8p in the Lsm2-Lsm8 ring and suggest that Lhp1p acts redundantly with the entire Lsm2-Lsm8 complex to stabilize nascent U6 snRNA.$\backslash$n},

This workflow combines principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA), orthogonal 2 projections to latent structures (O2PLS), and shared and unique structures (SUS) plots. The workflow is demonstrated using data from a study in which ApoE3Leiden mice were fed an atherogenic diet consisting of increasing cholesterol levels followed by therapeutic intervention (fenofibrate, rosuvastatin, and LXR activator T-0901317). The levels of structural lipids (lipidomics) and free fatty acids in liver were quantified via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The complementary workflow identified diglycerides as key hepatic metabolites affected by dietary cholesterol and drug intervention. Modeling of the three therapeutics for mice fed a high-cholesterol diet further highlighted diglycerides as metabolites of interest in atherogenesis, suggesting a role in eliciting chronic liver inflammation. In particular, O2PLS-based SUS2 plots showed that treatment with T-0901317 or rosuvastatin returned the diglyceride profile in high-cholesterol-fed mice to that of control animals.},

abstract = {A pplications of NMR for metabolomics and metabolic profiling continue to grow rapidly as does the refinement of methods for the measurement, analysis, and interpretation of complex data sets. Metabolomics (metabonomics) is a set of global measurements performed on biological samples with the goal of quantifying as many metabolites as possible and evaluating changes in metabolite levels as a result of an applied stress. Metabolic profiling experiments follow a more limited set of metabolites often through specific pathways. NMR is also well suited for metabolite fingerprinting, which involves the comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of a wide variety of compounds. For the purpose of this Review, we do not distin-guish between metabolomics and metabonomics and have elected to use the term metabolomics throughout. Figure 1 illustrates the rapid growth in publications on topics that include the keywords NMR and metabolomics/metabonomics since the year 2000. Due to space limitations, this Review covers only papers published between 2011 and the first half of 2014.},

abstract = {Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in discovery and development settings are described. In the discovery setting `the rule of 5' predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely when there are more than 5 H-bond donors, 10 H-bond acceptors, the molecular weight (MWT) is greater than 500 and the calculated Log P (CLogP) is greater than 5 (or MlogP{\textgreater}4.15). Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

abstract = {The heterotrimeric mTORC1 protein kinase nucleates a signaling network that promotes cell growth in response to insulin and becomes constitutively active in cells missing the TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressors. Insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of S6K1, an mTORC1 substrate, but it is not known how mTORC1 kinase activity is regulated. We identify PRAS40 as a raptor-interacting protein that binds to mTORC1 in insulin-deprived cells and whose in vitro interaction with mTORC1 is disrupted by high salt concentrations. PRAS40 inhibits cell growth, S6K1 phosphorylation, and rheb-induced activation of the mTORC1 pathway, and in vitro it prevents the great increase in mTORC1 kinase activity induced by rheb1-GTP. Insulin stimulates Akt/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40, which prevents its inhibition of mTORC1 in cells and in vitro. We propose that the relative strengths of the rheb- and PRAS40-mediated inputs to mTORC1 set overall pathway activity and that insulin activates mTORC1 through the coordinated regulation of both. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more.Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

abstract = {Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC tumorigenesis is not always accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) has been found activated in TSC lesions lacking TSC1 or TSC2 LOH. Here, we show that Erk may play a critical role in TSC progression through posttranslational inactivation of TSC2. Erk-dependent phosphorylation leads to TSC1-TSC2 dissociation and markedly impairs TSC2 ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. Importantly, expression of an Erk nonphosphorylatable TSC2 mutant in TSC2+/-tumor cells where Erk is constitutively activated blocks tumorigenecity in vivo, while wild-type TSC2 is ineffective. Our findings position the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream of the TSC complex and suggest that Erk may modulate mTOR signaling and contribute to disease progression through phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2.

abstract = {Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase that controls cell growth and metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, cellular energy, and stress. TOR, which was originally discovered in yeast, is conserved in all eukaryotes including plants, worms, flies, and mammals. The discovery of TOR led to a fundamental change in how we think about cell growth. It is not a spontaneous process that just happens when building blocks (nutrients) are available, but rather a highly regulated, plastic process controlled by TOR-dependent signaling pathways. TOR is found in 2 structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2. The 2 TOR complexes, like TOR itself, are highly conserved. Mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) is rapamycin sensitive and contains mTOR, raptor, and mLST8. TORC1 in yeast and mammals mediates temporal control of cell growth by regulating several cellular processes, including translation, transcription, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient transport, and autophagy. mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and contains mTOR, rictor, mSIN1, PRR5, and mLST8. TORC2 in yeast and mammals mediates spatial control of cell growth by regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the 2 TOR complexes constitute an ancestral signaling network conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution to control the fundamental process of cell growth. As a central controller of cell growth, TOR plays a key role in development and aging and has been implicated in disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. The challenge now is to understand the role of mTOR signaling to coordinate and integrate overall body growth in multicellular organisms. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast or budding yeast) is an excellent eukaryotic model system for cellular biology with a well-explored, completely sequenced genome. Yeast cells possess robust systems for osmotic adaptation. Central to the response to high osmolarity is the HOG pathway, one of the best-explored MAP kinase pathways. This pathway controls via different transcription factors the expression of more than 150 genes. In addition, osmotic responses are also controlled by protein kinase A via a general stress response pathway and by presently unknown signaling systems. The HOG pathway partially controls expression of genes encoding enzymes in glycerol production. Glycerol is the main yeast osmolyte, and its production is essential for growth in a high osmolarity medium. Upon hypo-osmotic shock, yeast cells transiently stimulate another MAP kinase pathway, the so-called PKC pathway, which appears to orchestrate the assembly of the cell surface and the cell wall. In addition, yeast cells show signs of a regulated volume decrease by rapidly exporting glycerol through Fps1p. This unusual MIP channel is gated by osmotic changes and thereby plays a key role in controlling the intracellular osmolyte content. Yeast cells also possess two aquaporins, Aqy1p and Aqy2p. The production of both proteins is strictly regulated, suggesting that these water channels play very specific roles in yeast physiology. Aqy1p appears to be developmentally regulated. Given the strong yeast research community and the excellent tools of genetics and functional genomics available, we expect yeast to be the best-explored cellular organism for several years ahead, and osmotic responses are a focus of interest for numerous yeast researchers. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Cells process signals using complex and dynamic networks. Studying how this is performed in a context and cell type specific way is essential to understand signaling both in physiological and diseased situations. Context-specific medium/high throughput proteomic data measured upon perturbation is now relatively easy to obtain but formalisms that can take advantage of these features to build models of signaling are still comparatively scarce. RESULTS Here we present CellNOptR, an open-source R software package for building predictive logic models of signaling networks by training networks derived from prior knowledge to signaling (typically phosphoproteomic) data. CellNOptR features different logic formalisms, from Boolean models to differential equations, in a common framework. These different logic model representations accommodate state and time values with increasing levels of detail. We provide in addition an interface via Cytoscape (CytoCopteR) to facilitate use and integration with Cytoscape network-based capabilities. CONCLUSIONS Models generated with this pipeline have two key features. First, they are constrained by prior knowledge about the network but trained to data. They are therefore context and cell line specific, which results in enhanced predictive and mechanistic insights. Second, they can be built using different logic formalisms depending on the richness of the available data. Models built with CellNOptR are useful tools to understand how signals are processed by cells and how this is altered in disease. They can be used to predict the effect of perturbations (individual or in combinations), and potentially to engineer therapies that have differential effects/side effects depending on the cell type or context.},

abstract = {Synthetic biological engineering is emerging from biology as a distinct discipline based on quantification. The technologies propelling synthetic biology are not new, nor is the concept of designing novel biological molecules. What is new is the emphasis on system behavior. The objective is the design and construction of new biological devices and systems to deliver useful applications. Numerous synthetic gene circuits have been created in the past decade, including bistable switches, oscillators, and logic gates, and possible applications abound, including biofuels, detectors for biochemical and chemical weapons, disease diagnosis, and gene therapies. More than fifty years after the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA, molecular biology is mature enough for real quantification that is useful for biological engineering applications, similar to the revolution in modeling in chemistry in the 1950s. With the excitement that synthetic biology is generating, the engineering and biological science communities appear remarkably willing to cross disciplinary boundaries toward a common goal.},

abstract = {People often refer to entities in an image in terms of their relationships with other entities. For example, "the black cat sitting under the table" refers to both a "black cat" entity and its relationship with another "table" entity. Understanding these relationships is essential for interpreting and grounding such natural language expressions. Most prior work focuses on either grounding entire referential expressions holistically to one region, or localizing relationships based on a fixed set of categories. In this paper we instead present a modular deep architecture capable of analyzing referential expressions into their component parts, identifying entities and relationships mentioned in the input expression and grounding them all in the scene. We call this approach Compositional Modular Networks (CMNs): a novel architecture that learns linguistic analysis and visual inference end-to-end. Our approach is built around two types of neural modules that inspect local regions and pairwise interactions between regions. We evaluate CMNs on multiple referential expression datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.},

abstract = {A major mRNA decay pathway in eukaryotes is initiated by deadenylation followed by decapping of the oligoadenylated mRNAs and subsequent 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic degradation of the capless mRNA. In this pathway, decapping is a rate-limiting step that requires the hetero-octameric Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex to occur at normal rates in vivo. This complex is made up of the seven Sm-like proteins, Lsm1 through Lsm7, and the Pat1 protein. It binds RNA and has a unique binding preference for oligoadenylated RNAs over polyadenylated RNAs. Such binding ability is crucial for its mRNA decay function in vivo. In order to determine the contribution of Pat1 to the function of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex, we compared the RNA binding properties of the Lsm1-7 complex purified from pat1$\Delta$ cells and purified Pat1 fragments with that of the wild-type Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex. Our studies revealed that both the Lsm1-7 complex and purified Pat1 fragments have very low RNA binding activity and are impaired in the ability to recognize the oligo(A) tail on the RNA. However, reconstitution of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex from these components restored these abilities. We also observed that Pat1 directly contacts RNA in the context of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex. These studies suggest that the unique RNA binding properties and the mRNA decay function of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex involve cooperation of residues from both Pat1 and the Lsm1-7 ring. Finally our studies also revealed that the middle domain of Pat1 is essential for the interaction of Pat1 with the Lsm1-7 complex in vivo.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prime example of a complex and heterogeneous disorder, characterized by multifaceted and varied motor-and non-motor symptoms and different possible interplays of genetic and environmental risk factors. While investigations of individual PD-causing mutations and risk factors in isolation are providing important insights to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind PD, there is a growing consensus that a more complete understanding of these mechanisms will require an integrative modeling of multifactorial disease-associated perturbations in molecular networks. Identifying and interpreting the combinatorial effects of multiple PD-associated molecular changes may pave the way towards an earlier and reliable diagnosis and more effective therapeutic interventions. This review provides an overview of computational systems biology approaches developed in recent years to study multifactorial molecular alterations in complex disorders, with a focus on PD research applications. Strengths and weaknesses of different cellular pathway and network analyses, and multivariate machine learning techniques for investigating PD-related omics data are discussed, and strategies proposed to exploit the synergies of multiple biological knowledge and data sources. A final outlook provides an overview of specific challenges and possible next steps for translating systems biology findings in PD to new omics-based diagnostic tools and targeted, drug-based therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of the control and activity of the autophagy-lysosomal protein degradation machinery is emerging as an important theme for neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. However, the underlying regulatory and functional networks of known genes controlling autophagy and lysosomal function and their role in disease are relatively unexplored. We performed a systems biology-based integrative computational analysis to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models for regulation and function of genes involved in autophagy and lysosomal function. Specifically, we analyzed transcriptional and microRNA-based posttranscriptional regulation of these genes and performed functional enrichment analyses to understand their involvement in nervous system-related diseases and phenotypes. Transcriptional regulatory network analysis showed that binding sites for transcription factors, SREBP1, USF, AP-1 and NFE2, are common among autophagy and lysosomal genes. MicroRNA enrichment analysis revealed miR-130, 98, 124, 204 and 142 as the putative posttranscriptional regulators of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway genes. Pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the mTOR and insulin signaling pathways are important in the regulation of genes involved in autophagy. In addition, we found that glycosaminoglycan and glycosphingolipid pathways also make a major contribution to lysosomal gene regulation. The analysis confirmed the known contribution of the autophagy-lysosomal genes to Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases and also revealed potential involvement in tuberous sclerosis, neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses, sepsis, and lung, liver and prostatic neoplasms. To further probe the impact of autophagy-lysosomal gene deficits on neurologically-linked phenotypes, we also mined the mouse knockout phenotype data for the autophagy-lysosomal genes and found them to be highly predictive of nervous system dysfunction. Overall this study demonstrates the utility of systems biology-based approaches for understanding the autophagy-lysosomal pathways and gaining additional insights into the potential impact of defects in these complex biological processes.},

EGF receptor dimerization is mediated by a unique dimerization arm, which becomes exposed only after a dramatic domain rearrangement is promoted by growth factor binding. ErbB2, a family member that has no ligand, has its dimerization arm constitutively exposed, and this explains several of its unique properties. We outline a mechanistic view of ErbB receptor homo- and heterodimerization, which suggests new approaches for interfering with these processes when they are implicated in human cancers.},

abstract = {Genome-scale molecular networks, including protein interaction and gene regulatory networks, have taken centre stage in the investigation of the burgeoning disciplines of systems biology and biocomplexity. What do networks tell us? Some see in networks simply the comprehensive, detailed description of all cellular pathways, others seek in networks simple, higher-order qualities that emerge from the collective action of the individual pathways. This paper discusses networks from an encompassing category of thinking that will hopefully help readers to bridge the gap between these polarised viewpoints. Systems biology so far has emphasised the characterisation of large pathway maps. Now one has to ask: where is the actual biology in 'systems biology'? As structures midway between genome and phenome, and by serving as an 'extended genotype' or an 'elementary phenotype', molecular networks open a new window to the study of evolution and gene function in complex living systems. For the study of evolution, features in network topology offer a novel starting point for addressing the old debate on the relative contributions of natural selection versus intrinsic constraints to a particular trait. To study the function of genes, it is necessary not only to see them in the context of gene networks, but also to reach beyond describing network topology and to embrace the global dynamics of networks that will reveal higher-order, collective behaviour of the interacting genes. This will pave the way to understanding how the complexity of genome-wide molecular networks collapses to produce a robust whole-cell behaviour that manifests as tightly-regulated switching between distinct cell fates - the basis for multicellular life.},

abstract = {The MutT/Nudix superfamily proteins repair DNA damage and play a role in human health and disease. In this study, we examined two different cases of double MutT/Nudix domain-containing proteins from eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Firstly, these double domain proteins were discovered in Drosophila, but only single Nudix domain proteins were found in other animals. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the protein sequence of Nudix{\_}N and Nudix{\_}C from Drosophila, and Nudix from other animals. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the double Nudix domain proteins might have undergone a gene duplication-speciation-fusion process. Secondly, two genes of the MutT family, DR0004 and DR0329, were fused by two mutT gene segments and formed double MutT domain protein genes in Deinococcus radiodurans. The evolutionary tree of bacterial MutT proteins suggested that the double MutT domain proteins in D. radiodurans probably resulted from a gene duplication-fusion event after speciation. Gene duplication-fusion is a basic and important gene innovation mechanism for the evolution of double MutT/Nudix domain proteins. Independent gene duplication-fusion events resulted in similar domain architectures of different double MutT/Nudix domain proteins. ?? 2009 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.},

We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96{\%} of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7{\%} of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions.

Consequently, eukaryotic organisms have evolved multi-potent and efficient mechanisms to repair DSBs that are primarily divided into two types of pathways: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR).

Moreover, Akt/PKB can phosphorylate tuberin in vitro and in vivo. We also show that S939 and T1462 of tuberin are PI3K-regulated phosphorylation sites and that T1462 is constitutively phosphorylated in PTEN-/- tumor-derived cell lines.

abstract = {Branched-chain amino acid uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is mediated by at least three transport systems: the general amino acid permease Gap1p, the branched-chain amino acid permease Bap2p, and one or more so far unknown permeases. Regulation of the transcription of BAP2 is mainly subject to the presence of certain amino acids in the medium. The level of transcription is low during growth on a minimal medium with proline as the sole nitrogen source. As assayed with a lacZ fusion, the level of transcription is slightly higher (3-fold) on a minimal medium with ammonium ions as a nitrogen source, and transcription is induced about 20-fold by addition of leucine (0.2 mM). As little as 10 microM leucine causes a fivefold induction. Addition of (L)-leucine to minimal proline medium, on the other hand, has no effect on BAP2 transcription. The two known permeases for transport of branched-chain amino acids, Gap1p and Bap2p, are thus not active at the same time. The BAP2 promoter contains one or two putative Gcn4p binding sites and one putative Leu3p binding site. None of the three is needed for induction by leucine. Induction of BAP2 transcription by leucine is accompanied by an increase in branched-chain amino acid uptake. This elevation is interpreted to be partly the result of an increased level of the Bap2p permease in the plasma membrane, because deletion of BAP2 slightly decreases the induction of uptake. There is still a leucine-inducible increase in branched-chain amino acid uptake in a delta gap1 delta bap2 strain, indicating that BAP2 shares leucine induction with at least one remaining branched-chain amino acid-transporting permease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The understanding of the molecular sources for diseases like cancer can be significantly improved by computational models. Recently, Boolean networks have become very popular for modeling signaling and regulatory networks. However, such models rely on a set of Boolean functions that are in general not known. Unfortunately, while detailed information on the molecular interactions becomes available in large scale through electronic databases, the information on the Boolean functions does not become available simultaneously and has to be included manually into the models, if at all known.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a new Boolean approach which can directly utilize the mechanistic network information available through modern databases. The Boolean function is implicitly defined by the reaction mechanisms. Special care has been taken for the treatment of kinetic features like inhibition. The method has been applied to a signaling model combining the Wnt and MAPK pathway.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: A sample C++ implementation of the proposed method is available for Linux and compatible systems through http://code.google.com/p/libscopes/wiki/Paper2011.},

Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact in the two-hybrid system, but their localization in the cell may be different thus raising the question whether the interaction is physiologically relevant. Here we demonstrate that the two proteins function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in an rvs161Delta strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167Delta strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we show that the interaction of Rvs167p with actin is not abolished in an abp1Delta strain suggesting that Abp1p is not essential for this interaction.},

abstract = {Systems biology is a new discipline built upon the premise that an understanding of how cells and organisms carry out their functions cannot be gained by looking at cellular components in isolation. Instead, consideration of the interplay between the parts of systems is indispensable for analyzing, modeling, and predicting systems' behavior. Studying biological processes under this premise, systems biology combines experimental techniques and computational methods in order to construct predictive models. Both in building and utilizing models of biological systems, inverse problems arise at several occasions, for example, (i) when experimental time series and steady state data are used to construct biochemical reaction networks, (ii) when model parameters are identified that capture underlying mechanisms or (iii) when desired qualitative behavior such as bistability or limit cycle oscillations is engineered by proper choices of parameter combinations. In this paper we review principles of the modeling process in systems biology and illustrate the ill-posedness and regularization of parameter identification problems in that context. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology of qualitative inverse problems and demonstrate how sparsity enforcing regularization allows the determination of key reaction mechanisms underlying the qualitative behavior.},

The integration of network analysis and dynamic modeling enables one to investigate the behavior of the underlying system as a whole and to make experimentally testable predictions about less-understood aspects of the processes involved. In this paper, we present a tutorial on the fundamental steps of Boolean modeling of biological regulatory networks. We demonstrate how to infer a Boolean network model from the available experimental data, analyze the network using graph-theoretical measures, and convert it into a predictive dynamic model.

abstract = {Motivation: As the study of information processing in living cells moves from individual pathways to complex regulatory networks, mathematical models and simulation become indispensable tools for analyzing the complex behavior of such networks and can provide deep insights into the functioning of cells. The dynamics of gene expression, for example, can be modeled with Boolean networks (BNs). These are mathematical models of low complexity, but have the advantage of being able to capture essential properties of gene-regulatory networks. However, current implementations of BNs only focus on different sub-aspects of this model and do not allow for a seamless integration into existing preprocessing pipelines. Results: BoolNet efficiently integrates methods for synchronous, asynchronous and probabilistic BNs. This includes reconstructing networks from time series, generating random networks, robustness analysis via perturbation, Markov chain simulations, and identification and visualization of attractors.

abstract = {Risk perceptions concerning genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are often considered to reflect media coverage. However, it might be said that people seek out information consistent with their attitudes and avoid information which could challenge them. This process refers to the selective exposure principle derived from cognitive dissonance theory. Although this principle is now well established, the only two studies carried out to date in the field of GMOs have produced contradictory results. Additionally, no study has considered the link between risk perceptions, threat perceptions and attitudes as possible antecedents of selective exposure in the field of GMOs. The aim of the present research was to fill this gap. Results of a multiple-mediation model showed that people did in fact expose themselves selectively in the field of GMOs: The higher the level of general risk perception they reported, the higher the perceived threat, the more negative their attitude towards GMOs and the greater their inclination to expose themselves to information on the harmful effects of GM food. We discuss the consequences of selective exposure and the potential levers which could favor exposure to pros and cons, thereby also favoring informed food choices.},

Progress has been made in engineering DNA binding domains to direct proteins to particular sequences for mutagenesis or manipulation of transcription; however, achieving the requisite specificities has been challenging. Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors of plant pathogenic bacteria contain a modular DNA binding domain that appears to overcome this challenge. Comprising tandem, polymorphic amino acid repeats that individually specify contiguous nucleotides in DNA, this domain is being deployed in DNA targeting for applications ranging from understanding gene function in model organisms to improving traits in crop plants to treating genetic disorders in people.},

abstract = {Background The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides unique opportunities to study roles and regulation of aqua/glyceroporins using frontline tools of genetics and genomics as well as molecular cell and systems biology. Scope of review S. cerevisiae has two similar orthodox aquaporins. Based on phenotypes mediated by gene deletion or overexpression as well as on their expression pattern, the yeast aquaporins play important roles in key aspects of yeast biology: establishment of freeze tolerance, during spore formation as well as determination of cell surface properties for substrate adhesion and colony formation. Exactly how the aquaporins perform those roles and the mechanisms that regulate their function under such conditions remain to be elucidated. S. cerevisiae also has two different aquaglyceroporins. While the role of one of them, Yfl054c, remains to be determined, Fps1 plays critical roles in osmoregulation by controlling the accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol. Fps1 communicates with two osmo-sensing MAPK signalling pathways to perform its functions but the details of Fps1 regulation remain to be determined. Major conclusions Several phenotypes associated with aqua/glyceroporin function in yeasts have been established. However, how water and glycerol transport contribute to the observed effects is not understood in detail. Also many of the basic principles of regulation of yeast aqua/glyceroporins remain to be elucidated. General significance Studying the yeast aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins offers rich insight into the life style, evolution and adaptive responses of yeast and rewards us with discoveries of unexpected roles and regulatory mechanisms of members of this ancient protein family.

abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural analysis of cellular interaction networks contributes to a deeper understanding of network-wide interdependencies, causal relationships, and basic functional capabilities. While the structural analysis of metabolic networks is a well-established field, similar methodologies have been scarcely developed and applied to signaling and regulatory networks. RESULTS: We propose formalisms and methods, relying on adapted and partially newly introduced approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and regulatory networks with focus on functional aspects. We use two different formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation of elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the set of signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation of intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors with respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects induced by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the network scheme. Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture AND relationships which do frequently occur in interaction networks. The consequent logical concatenation of all the arcs pointing into a species leads to Boolean networks. For a Boolean representation of cellular interaction networks we propose a formalism based on logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs, which facilitates in particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA). LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the identification of optimal intervention points (targets) in cellular networks. LSSA also reveals network regions whose parametrization and initial states are crucial for the dynamic behavior. We have implemented these methods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate their applicability using a logical model of T-Cell receptor signaling providing non-intuitive results regarding feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon different stimuli. CONCLUSION: The methods and formalisms we propose herein are another step towards the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular interaction networks. Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell signaling model, makes them a promising tool.},

abstract = {The Gab1 protein is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to various growth factors and serves as a docking protein that recruits a number of downstream signaling proteins, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase). To determine the role of Gab1 in signaling via the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) we tested the ability of Gab1 to associate with and modulate signaling by this receptor. We show that Gab1 associates with the EGFR in vivo and in vitro via pTyr sites 1068 and 1086 in the carboxy-terminal tail of the receptor and that overexpression of Gab1 potentiates EGF-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun kinase signaling pathways. A mutant of Gab1 unable to bind the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase is defective in potentiating EGFR signaling, confirming a role for PI-3 kinase as a downstream effector of Gab1. Inhibition of PI-3 kinase by a dominant-interfering mutant of p85 or by Wortmannin treatment similarly impairs Gab1-induced enhancement of signaling via the EGFR. The PH domain of Gab1 was shown to bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], a product of PI-3 kinase, and is required for activation of Gab1-mediated enhancement of EGFR signaling. Moreover, the PH domain mediates Gab1 translocation to the plasma membrane in response to EGF and is required for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 upon EGF stimulation. In addition, overexpression of Gab1 PH domain blocks Gab1 potentiation of EGFR signaling. Finally, expression of the gene for the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4, 5)P3, inhibits EGF signaling and translocation of Gab1 to the plasma membrane. These results reveal a novel positive feedback loop, modulated by PTEN, in which PI-3 kinase functions as both an upstream regulator and a downstream effector of Gab1 in signaling via the EGFR.},

abstract = {The biomolecules inside or near cells form a complex interacting system. Cellular phenotypes and behaviors arise from the totality of interactions among the components of this system. A fruitful way of modeling interacting biomolecular systems is by network-based dynamic models that characterize each component by a state variable, and describe the change in the state variables due to the interactions in the system. Dynamic models can capture the stable state patterns of this interacting system and can connect them to different cell fates or behaviors. A Boolean or logic model characterizes each biomolecule by a binary state variable that relates the abundance of that molecule to a threshold abundance necessary for downstream processes. The regulation of this state variable is described in a parameter free manner, making Boolean modeling a practical choice for systems whose kinetic parameters have not been determined. Boolean models integrate the body of knowledge regarding the components and interactions of biomolecular systems, and capture the system's dynamic repertoire, for example the existence of multiple cell fates. These models were used for a variety of systems and led to important insights and predictions. Boolean models serve as an efficient exploratory model, a guide for follow-up experiments, and as a foundation for more quantitative models.},

abstract = {Ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), as a key regulator of mRNA translation, plays an important role in cell cycle progression through the G(1) phase of proliferating cells and in the synaptic plasticity of terminally differentiated neurons. Activation of S6K1 involves the phosphorylation of its multiple Ser/Thr residues, including the proline-directed sites (Ser-411, Ser-418, Thr-421, and Ser-424) in the autoinhibitory domain near the C terminus. Phosphorylation at Thr-389 is also a crucial event in S6K1 activation. Here, we report that S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 is required for the rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation of Thr-389 and the subsequent activation of S6K1. Mutation of Ser-411 to Ala ablated insulin-induced Thr-389 phosphorylation and S6K1 activation, whereas mutation mimicking Ser-411 phosphorylation did not show any effect. Furthermore, phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-389 overcame the inhibitory effect of the mutation S411A. Thus, Ser-411 phosphorylation regulates S6K1 activation via the control of Thr-389 phosphorylation. In nervous system neurons, Cdk5-p35 kinase associates with S6K1 via the direct interaction between p35 and S6K1 and catalyzes S6K1 phosphorylation specifically at Ser-411. Inhibition of the Cdk5 activity or suppression of Cdk5 expression blocked S6K1 phosphorylation at Ser-411 and Thr-389, resulting in S6K1 inactivation. Similar results were obtained by treating asynchronous populations of proliferating cells with the CDK inhibitor compound roscovitine. Altogether, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which the CDK-mediated phosphorylation regulates the activation of S6K1.},

The extended entity-relationship model is then decomposed according to a set of basic entity-relationship constructs, and these are transformed into candidate relations. A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired. The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization. This approach can be implemented manually or in a simple software package as long as a "good" solution is acceptable and absolute optimality is not required.},

The sensor comprised an ECR carbon electrode modified with gabase co-immobilized bovine serum albumin. We obtained stable responses for NADPH without any electrode surface fouling by electrochemically pretreating the ECR carbon electrode because ECR carbon has an extremely flat surface even after pretreatment and increasing the surface oxygen made the surface more hydrophilic thus suppressing oxidized NADPH (NADP+) fouling of the surface. As a result, we obtained a very low detection limit of 10 nM for NADPH, which was more than one order of magnitude better than that of a conventional glassy carbon electrode (250 nM). We also achieved a low detection limit of 30 nM GABA within 2 min by modifying the pretreated ECR carbon electrode with gabase.

abstract = {A key event for Ras transformation involves the direct physical association between Ras and the Raf-1 kinase. This interaction promotes both Raf translocation to the plasma membrane and activation of Raf kinase activity. Although substantial experimental evidence has demonstrated that Raf residues 51-131 alone are sufficient for Ras binding, conflicting observations have suggested that the Raf cysteine-rich domain (residues 139-184) may also be important for interaction with Ras. To clarify the role of the Raf cysteine-rich domain in Ras-Raf binding, we have compared the ability of two distinct Raf fragments to interact with Ras using both in vitro Ras binding and in vivo Ras inhibition assays. First, we determined that both Raf sequences 2-140 and 139-186 (designated Raf-Cys) showed preferential binding to active, GTP-bound Ras in vitro. Second, we observed that Raf-Cys antagonized oncogenic Ras(Q61L)-mediated transactivation of Ras-responsive elements and focus-forming activity in NIH 3T3 cells and insulin-induced germinal vesicle breakdown in Xenopus laevis oocytes in vivo. This inhibitory activity suggests that Raf-Cys can interact with Ras in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that Ras interaction with two distinct domains of Raf-1 may be important in Ras-mediated activation of Raf kinase activity.},

abstract = {Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become the assay of choice for high-throughput studies of gene expression. However, as is the case with microarrays, major technology-related artifacts and biases affect the resulting expression measures. Normalization is therefore essential to ensure accurate inference of expression levels and subsequent analyses thereof. We focus on biases related to GC-content and demonstrate the existence of strong sample-specific GC-content effects on RNA-Seq read counts, which can substantially bias differential expression analysis. We propose three simple within-lane gene-level GC-content normalization approaches and assess their performance on two different RNA-Seq datasets, involving different species and experimental designs. Our methods are compared to state-of-the-art normalization procedures in terms of bias and mean squared error for expression fold-change estimation and in terms of Type I error and p-value distributions for tests of differential expression. The exploratory data analysis and normalization methods proposed in this article are implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R package EDASeq. Our within-lane normalization procedures, followed by between-lane normalization, reduce GC-content bias and lead to more accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression. Such results are crucial for the biological interpretation of RNA-Seq experiments, where downstream analyses can be sensitive to the supplied lists of genes.},

abstract = {The genome packaging reactions of tailed bacteriophages and herpes viruses require the activity of a terminase enzyme, which is comprised of large and small subunits. Phage genomes are replicated as linear concatemers composed of multiple copies of the genome joined end to end. As the terminase enzyme packages the genome into the phage capsid, it cleaves the DNA into single genome-length units. In this work, we show that the phage HK97 HNH protein, gp74, is required for the specific endonuclease activity of HK97 terminase and is essential for phage head morphogenesis. HNH proteins are a very common family of proteins generally associated with nuclease activity that are found in all kingdoms of life. We show that the activity of gp74 in terminase-mediated cleavage of the phage cos site relies on the presence of an HNH motif active-site residue, and that the large subunit of HK97 terminase physically interacts with gp74. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that the role of HNH proteins in terminase function is widespread among long-tailed phages and is uniquely required for the activity of the Terminase{\_}1 family of large terminase proteins.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The biological pathway exchange language (BioPAX) and the systems biology markup language (SBML) belong to the most popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology. The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX describes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML qualitative models extension (qual), it has recently also become possible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now, there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The entire nature pathway interaction database has been converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3 Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package.

The molecular understanding of osmosis has not yet been completely achieved, and the discovery of aquaporins as molecular entities involved in water transport has caused osmosis to again become a focus of research.

In a previous report, 20 X-ray structures of transmembrane proteins were analyzed in silico for their orientation in a 36A-thick membrane [J. Mol. Graph. Model. 20 (2001) 235]. In this paper, we use the same approach to analyze how the insertion of the X-ray structures varies with the bilayer thickness. The protein structures are kept constant and, at each membrane thickness, the protein is allowed to tilt and rotate in order to accommodate at their best. The conditions are said to be optimal when the energy of insertion is minimal. The results show that most helix bundles require thicker membranes than porin barrels. Moreover, in a few instances, the ideal membrane thickness is unrealistic with respect to natural membranes supporting that the X-ray structure requires adaptation to stabilize in membrane. For instance, the squalene cyclase could adapt by bending the side chains of its ring of lysine and arginine in order to increase the hydrophobic surface in contact with membranes. We analyzed the distribution of amino acids in the water, interface and acyl chain layers of the membrane and compared with the literature.},

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), we mapped genome-wide binding sites of catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) in HEK293T cells, in combination with 12 different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The number of off-target sites bound by dCas9 varied from approximately 10 to {\textgreater}1,000 depending on the sgRNA. Analysis of off-target binding sites showed the importance of the PAM-proximal region of the sgRNA guiding sequence and that dCas9 binding sites are enriched in open chromatin regions. When targeted with catalytically active Cas9, some off-target binding sites had indels above background levels in a region around the ChIP-seq peak, but generally at lower rates than the on-target sites. Our results elucidate major determinants of Cas9 targeting, and we show that ChIP-seq allows unbiased detection of Cas9 binding sites genome-wide.},

abstract = {Our growing knowledge about various molecular mechanisms is becoming increasingly more structured and accessible. Different repositories of molecular interactions and available literature enable construction of focused and high-quality molecular interaction networks. Novel tools for curation and exploration of such networks are needed, in order to foster the development of a systems biology environment. In particular, solutions for visualization, annotation and data cross-linking will facilitate usage of network-encoded knowledge in biomedical research. To this end we developed the MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRks VisuAlization) platform, a standalone webservice supporting curation, annotation and visualization of molecular interaction networks in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-compliant format. MINERVA provides automated content annotation and verification for improved quality control. The end users can explore and interact with hosted networks, and provide direct feedback to content curators. MINERVA enables mapping drug targets or overlaying experimental data on the visualized networks. Extensive export functions enable downloading areas of the visualized networks as SBGN-compliant models for efficient reuse of hosted networks. The software is available under Affero GPL 3.0 as a Virtual Machine snapshot, Debian package and Docker instance at http://r3lab. uni.lu/web/minerva-website/. We believe that MINERVA is an important contribution to systems biology community, as its architecture enables set-up of locally or globally accessible SBGN-oriented repositories of molecular interaction networks. Its functionalities allow overlay of multiple information layers, facilitating exploration of content and interpretation of data. Moreover, annotation and verification workflows of MINERVA improve the efficiency of curation of networks, allowing life-science researchers to better engage in development and use of biomedical knowledge repositories.},

Screens for synthetic lethal genetic interactions have been used extensively to identify genes whose products buffer one another or impinge on the same essential pathway. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of approx 5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing approximately 80{\%} of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different screens, including genetic suppression, plasmid shuffling, dosage lethality, or suppression.},

The duration of organ dysfunction prior to diagnosis was correlated with mortality. Results were considered significant if p{\textless}0.05.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled. Mean age was 55.6+/-20.7 years, mean APACHE II score was 20.6+/-6.9, and mean SOFA score was 7.9+/-3.7. Thirty-six patients (64.3{\%}) had septic shock. The mean duration of organ dysfunction was 1.9+/-1.9 days. Within the univariate analysis, the variables correlated with hospital mortality were: age (p=0.015), APACHE II (p=0.008), onset outside the intensive care unit (p=0.05), blood glucose control (p=0.05) and duration of organ dysfunction (p=0.0004). In the multivariate analysis, only a duration of organ dysfunction persisting longer than 48 hours correlated with mortality (p=0.004, OR: 8.73 (2.37-32.14)), whereas the APACHE II score remained only a slightly significant factor (p=0.049, OR: 1.11 (1.00-1.23)). Patients who received therapeutic interventions within the first 48 hours after the onset of organ dysfunction exhibited lower mortality (32.1{\%} vs. 82.1{\%}, p=0.0001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the diagnosis of organ dysfunction is not being made in a timely manner. The time elapsed between the onset of organ dysfunction and initiation of therapeutic intervention can be quite long, and this represents an important determinant of survival in cases of severe sepsis and septic shock.},

The Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal. However, the initial Fixed Bandwidth (FB) implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space. Here, we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm, based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (AP) for estimating the Mutual Information. The new AP implementation (ARACNe-AP) achieves a dramatic improvement in computational performance (200× on average) over the previous methodology, while preserving the Mutual Information estimator and the Network inference accuracy of the original algorithm. Given that the previous version of ARACNe is extremely demanding, the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational resources to build complex regulatory networks from hundreds of gene expression profiles.

Simulations agree well with experimental results obtained under different stress conditions or with specific mutants. The model is predictive since it suggests previously unrecognized features of the system with respect to osmolyte accumulation and feedback control, as confirmed with experiments.

abstract = {MOTIVATION Literature on complex diseases is abundant but not always quantitative. Many molecular pathways are qualitatively well described but this information cannot be used in traditional quantitative mathematical models employed in drug development. Tools for analysis of discrete networks are useful to capture the available information in the literature but have not been efficiently integrated by the pharmaceutical industry. We propose an expansion of the usual analysis of discrete networks that facilitates the identification/validation of therapeutic targets. RESULTS In this article, we propose a methodology to perform Boolean modeling of Systems Biology/Pharmacology networks by using SPIDDOR (Systems Pharmacology for effIcient Drug Development On R) R package. The resulting models can be used to analyze the dynamics of signaling networks associated to diseases to predict the pathogenesis mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets.

abstract = {This study characterizes the insulin-activated serine/threonine protein kinases in H4 hepatoma cells active on a 37-residue synthetic peptide (called the SKAIPS peptide) corresponding to a putative autoinhibitory domain in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the p70 S6 kinase as well as on recombinant p70 S6 kinase. Three peaks of insulin-stimulated protein kinase active on both these substrates are identified as two (possibly three) isoforms of the 40-45-kDa erk/microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 kinase family and a 150-kDa form of cdc2. Although distinguishable in their substrate specificity, these protein kinases together with the p54 MAP-2 kinase share a major common specificity determinant reflected in the SKAIPS peptide: the requirement for a proline residue immediately carboxyl-terminal to the site of Ser/Thr phosphorylation. In addition, however, at least one peak of insulin-stimulated protein kinase active on recombinant p70, but not on the SKAIPS peptide, is present although not yet identified. MFP/cdc2 phosphorylates both rat liver p70 S6 kinase and recombinant p70 S6 kinase exclusively at a set of Ser/Thr residues within the putative autoinhibitory (SKAIPS peptide) domain. erk/MAP kinase does not phosphorylate rat liver p70 S6 kinase, but readily phosphorylates recombinant p70 S6 kinase at sites both within and in addition to those encompassed by the SKAIPS peptide sequences. Although the tryptic 32P-peptides bearing the cdc2 and erk/MAP kinase phosphorylation sites co-migrate with a subset of the sites phosphorylated in situ in insulin-stimulated cells, phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase by these proline-directed protein kinases in vitro does not reproducibly activate p70 S6 kinase activity. Thus, one or more erk/MAP kinases and cdc2 are likely to participate in the insulin-induced phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase. In addition to these kinases, however, phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase by other as yet unidentified protein kinases is necessary to recapitulate the multisite phosphorylation required for activation of the p70 S6 kinase.},

abstract = {AutoDock 2.4 predicts the bound conformations of a small, flexible ligand to a nonflexible macromolecular target of known structure. The technique combines simulated annealing for conformation searching with a rapid grid-based method of energy evaluation based on the AMBER force field. AutoDock has been optimized in performance without sacrificing accuracy; it incorporates many enhancements and additions, including an intuitive interface. We have developed a set of tools for launching and analyzing many independent docking jobs in parallel on a heterogeneous network of UNIX-based workstations. This paper describes the current release, and the results of a suite of diverse test systems. We also present the results of a systematic investigation into the effects of varying simulated-annealing parameters on molecular docking. We show that even for ligands with a large number of degrees of freedom, root-mean-square deviations of less than 1 A from the crystallographic conformation are obtained for the lowest-energy dockings, although fewer dockings find the crystallographic conformation when there are more degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Vav2 is a member of the Vav family that serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factors for the Rho family of Ras-related GTPases. Unlike Vav1 whose expression is restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin, Vav2 is broadly expressed. Recently, Vav2 has been identified as a substrate for the EGF receptor, however, the mechanism by which Vav2 is activated in EGF-treated cells is unclear. By the means of an in vitro protein kinase assay, we show here that purified and activated EGF receptor phosphorylates Vav2 exclusively on its N-terminal domain. Furthermore, EGF receptor phosphorylates Vav2 on all three possible phosphorylation sites, Tyr-142, Tyr-159, and Tyr-172. In intact cells we also show that Vav2 associates with the activated EGF receptor in an SH2 domain-dependent manner, with Vav2 SH2 domain binding preferentially to autophosphorylation sites pTyr-992 and pTyr-1148 of the EGF receptor. Treatment of cells with EGF results in stimulation of exchange activity of Vav2 as measured on Rac, however, the intensity of the exchange activity does not show any correlation with the level of Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Introducing a point mutation into the Vav2 PH domain or treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 prior to EGF stimulation inhibits Vav2 exchange activity. While phosphorylation mutants of Vav2 can readily induce actin rearrangement in COS7 cells, PH domain mutant does not stimulate membrane ruffling. These results suggest that EGF regulates Vav2 activity basically through PI 3-kinase activation, while tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 may rather be necessary for mediating protein-protein interactions.},

Screens for synthetic lethal genetic interactions have been used extensively to identify genes whose products buffer one another or impinge on the same essential pathway. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of approx 5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing approximately 80{\%} of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different screens, including genetic suppression, plasmid shuffling, dosage lethality, or suppression.},

This method can be defined as indirect molecular design by the iterative sampling of the chemical compounds space to optimize a certain property and thus indirectly design the molecular structure having this property. However, modeling the interactions of chemical molecules in biological systems provides highly noisy data, which make predictions a roulette risk. In this paper we briefly review the origins for this noise, particularly in multidimensional QSAR. This was classified as the data, superimposition, molecular similarity, conformational, and molecular recognition noise. We also indicated possible robust answers that can improve modeling and predictive ability of QSAR, especially the self-organizing mapping of molecular objects, in particular, the molecular surfaces, a method that was brought into chemistry by Gasteiger and Zupan.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form a large protein family that plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. However, the central role that the biogenic amine binding GPCRs and their ligands play in cell signaling poses a risk in new drug candidates that reveal side affinities towards these receptor sites. These candidates have the potential to interfere with the physiological signaling processes and to cause undesired effects in preclinical or clinical studies. Here, we present 3D cross-chemotype pharmacophore models for three biogenic amine antitargets: the alpha(1A) adrenergic, the 5-HT(2A) serotonin, and the D2 dopamine receptors. These pharmacophores describe the key chemical features present within these biogenic amine antagonists and rationalize the biogenic amine side affinities found for numerous new drug candidates. First applications of the alpha(1A) adrenergic receptor model reveal that these in silico tools can be used to guide the chemical optimization towards development candidates with fewer alpha(1A)-mediated side effects (for example, orthostatic hypotension) and, thus, with an improved clinical safety profile.},

Most bioeconomy projections assume the widespread deployment of novel feedstocks developed through the use of modern molecular breeding techniques, but rarely consider the challenges involved with the use of genetically modified crops, which can include hurdles due to regulatory approvals, market adoption, and public acceptance. In this paper we consider the implications of various transgenic crops and traits under development for the bioeconomy that highlight these challenges. We believe that an awareness of the issues in crop and trait selection will allow developers to design crops with maximum stakeholder appeal and with the greatest potential for widespread adoption, while avoiding applications unlikely to meet regulatory approval or gain market and public acceptance.},

Despite extensive information on Msn2/4-mediated gene expression profiles, much less is known regarding the network of proteins that regulate its activity. Here we describe a systematic approach designed to examine the roles of 35 Msn2/4 partners in regulating Msn2/4 transcriptional activity in the face of four different environmental conditions. Our analysis indicates that single deletions of 26 Msn2/4 partners significantly affect Msn2/4 transcription activity under four different conditions. The low functional redundancy of the Msn2 regulatory network indicates that Msn2/4 activity is finely tuned by many of Msn2/4 partners to provide an optimized stress response through differential activation, nuclear localization, degradation, and chromatin remodeling. Our specific analysis of Msn2 activity showed that a relatively large number of partners act to suppress Msn2 activity under nonstress conditions through independent mechanisms, including cytoplasmic retention, proteosome-mediated Msn2 degradation, and chromatin remodeling. Such negative regulation is crucial to minimize the cost of uncontrolled stress response gene expression and ensures a high growth rate in the absence of stress.},

abstract = {Decapping is a critical step in the conserved 5'-to-3' mRNA decay pathway of eukaryotes. The hetero-octameric Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex is required for normal rates of decapping in this pathway. This complex also protects the mRNA 3'-ends from trimming in vivo. To elucidate the mechanism of decapping, we analyzed multiple lsm1 mutants, lsm1-6, lsm1-8, lsm1-9, and lsm1-14, all of which are defective in decapping and 3'-end protection but unaffected in Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex integrity. The RNA binding ability of the mutant complex was found to be almost completely lost in the lsm1-8 mutant but only partially impaired in the other mutants. Importantly, overproduction of the Lsm1-9p- or Lsm1-14p-containing (but not Lsm1-8p-containing) mutant complexes in wild-type cells led to a dominant inhibition of mRNA decay. Further, the mRNA 3'-end protection defect of lsm1-9 and lsm1-14 cells, but not the lsm1-8 cells, could be partly suppressed by overproduction of the corresponding mutant complexes in those cells. These results suggest the following: (1) Decapping requires both binding of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex to the mRNA and facilitation of the post-binding events, while binding per se is sufficient for 3'-end protection. (2) A major block exists at the post-binding steps in the lsm1-9 and lsm1-14 mutants and at the binding step in the lsm1-8 mutant. Consistent with these ideas, the lsm1-9, 14 allele generated by combining the mutations of lsm1-9 and lsm1-14 alleles had almost fully lost the RNA binding activity of the complex and behaved like the lsm1-8 mutant.},

abstract = {We and others recently demonstrated that the readily programmable CRISPR/Cas9 system can be used to edit the Drosophila genome. However, most applications to date have relied on aberrant DNA repair to stochastically generate frameshifting indels and adoption has been limited by a lack of tools for efficient identification of targeted events. Here we report optimized tools and techniques for expanded application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in Drosophila through homology-directed repair (HDR) with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) donor templates that facilitate complex genome engineering through the precise incorporation of large DNA sequences, including screenable markers. Using these donors, we demonstrate the replacement of a gene with exogenous sequences and the generation of a conditional allele. To optimize efficiency and specificity, we generated transgenic flies that express Cas9 in the germline and directly compared HDR and off-target cleavage rates of different approaches for delivering CRISPR components. We also investigated HDR efficiency in a mutant background previously demonstrated to bias DNA repair toward HDR. Finally, we developed a web-based tool that identifies CRISPR target sites and evaluates their potential for off-target cleavage using empirically rooted rules. Overall, we have found that injection of a dsDNA donor and guide RNA-encoding plasmids into vasa-Cas9 flies yields the highest efficiency HDR and that target sites can be selected to avoid off-target mutations. Efficient and specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR opens the door to a broad array of complex genome modifications and greatly expands the utility of CRISPR technology for Drosophila research.},

However, means to eliminate ROS are likely to be as important as the DNA repair mechanisms in order to suppress mutations in the chromosomal DNA, and yeasts also serve as excellent models to understand how eukaryotes combat oxidative stress. In this article, we present an overview of the signaling pathways that sense oxidative stress and induce expression of various anti-oxidant genes in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Three conserved signaling modules have been identified in the oxidative stress response of these diverse yeast species: the stress-responsive MAP kinase cascade, the multistep phosphorelay and the AP-1-like transcription factor.

abstract = {Motivation: As the study of information processing in living cells moves from individual pathways to complex regulatory networks, mathematical models and simulation become indispensable tools for analyzing the complex behavior of such networks and can provide deep insights into the functioning of cells. The dynamics of gene expression, for example, can be modeled with Boolean networks (BNs). These are mathematical models of low complexity, but have the advantage of being able to capture essential properties of gene-regulatory networks. However, current implementations of BNs only focus on different sub-aspects of this model and do not allow for a seamless integration into existing preprocessing pipelines. Results: BoolNet efficiently integrates methods for synchronous, asynchronous and probabilistic BNs. This includes reconstructing networks from time series, generating random networks, robustness analysis via perturbation, Markov chain simulations, and identification and visualization of attractors.

abstract = {Our studies on the biochemical basis of spontaneous mutations took an interesting and unexpected turn when we discovered that a small region of amino acid homology between the MutT protein of Escherichia coli and the MutX protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae was involved in their nucleoside triphosphatase as well as their antimutator activities (1–3). Computer searches of the data banks revealed that this same small conserved region was present in a number of other proteins in organisms ranging from viruses to humans (2, 4). Most of these proteins containing the signature are coded for by open reading frames (orfs) 1 whose products are either unidentified or of unknown function. We have been attempting, systematically, to identify and characterize enzymatic activities associated with these proteins, and it is now evident that nature has adopted this motif, originally identified as the active site of the nucleoside-triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase of MutT (5, 6), and adapted it for use in many diverse reactions distinct from its function in the MutT protein. This short review summarizes our present knowledge of those reactions catalyzed by proteins harbor-ing the MutT signature sequence and calls attention to a unique and versatile nucleotide binding and catalytic site. Although it might appear that the enzymes of this family act upon a wide variety of unrelated substrates, those characterized so far all hy-drolyze a nucleoside diphosphate linked to some other moiety, X. For convenience, and to correct a misapprehension, we propose the mnemonic " nudix " hydrolase for this family of enzymes to replace the " MutT family. " Currently, this signature sequence is desig-nated the " MutT pattern " in version 13.0 of the PROSITE data base of amino acid sequence motifs (7). This initial classification is misleading, because many, if not most, of these proteins are not involved directly in preventing mutations nor do they catalyze the archetypal nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolysis reac-tion originally described for MutT itself (5, 6). The MutT Prototype Characterization of the E. coli MutT protein, the progenitor of the family, followed from studies designed to elucidate the bio-chemical basis of the mutT mutator phenotype. Treffers et al. (8) originally described a mutant strain of E. coli, mutT1, with spon-taneous mutation frequencies ranging from 100-to 10,000-fold higher than normal. Yanofsky et al. (9) showed that unlike typical defective mutator genes causing a variety of derangements in DNA such as transitions, transversions, frameshifts, etc., mutT causes, exclusively, a single, unidirectional AT 3 CG transversion. This could be explained by either or both of the following base mispair-ing events during DNA replication.},

abstract = {We have analyzed ErbB receptor interplay induced by the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptides in cell lines naturally expressing the four ErbB receptors. Down-regulation of cell surface ErbB-1 or ErbB-2 by intracellular expression of specific antibodies has allowed us to delineate the role of these receptors during signaling elicited by: EGF and heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF), ligands of ErbB-1; betacellulin (BTC), a ligand of ErbB-1 and ErbB-4; and neu differentiation factor (NDF), a ligand of ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. Ligand-induced ErbB receptor heterodimerization follows a strict hierarchy and ErbB-2 is the preferred heterodimerization partner of all ErbB proteins. NDF-activated ErbB-3 or ErbB-4 heterodimerize with ErbB-1 only when no ErbB-2 is available. If all ErbB receptors are present, NDF receptors preferentially dimerize with ErbB-2. Furthermore, EGF- and BTC-induced activation of ErbB-3 is impaired in the absence of ErbB-2, suggesting that ErbB-2 has a role in the lateral transmission of signals between other ErbB receptors. Finally, ErbB-1 activated by all EGF-related peptides (EGF, HB-EGF, BTC and NDF) couples to SHC, whereas only ErbB-1 activated by its own ligands associates with and phosphorylates Cbl. These results provide the first biochemical evidence that a given ErbB receptor has distinct signaling properties depending on its dimerization.},

Screens for synthetic lethal genetic interactions have been used extensively to identify genes whose products buffer one another or impinge on the same essential pathway. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic lethal genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of approx 5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing approximately 80{\%} of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different screens, including genetic suppression, plasmid shuffling, dosage lethality, or suppression.},

Yet, the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions, systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide 'omics' studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components. Here, we outline the challenges faced by systems biology and discuss limitations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, which, despite these limitations, have already led to the discovery of mechanisms and principles that underlie cell function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {While signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) were originally discovered as intracellular effectors of normal signaling by cytokines, increasing evidence also points to a role for STAT transcription factors in oncogenesis. Previous studies have demonstrated that one STAT family member, Stat3, possesses constitutively elevated tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA-binding activity in fibroblasts stably transformed by the Src oncoprotein. To determine if this Stat3 activation by Src could induce Stat3-mediated gene expression, luciferase reporter constructs based on synthetic and authentic promoters were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Activation of endogenous cellular Stat3 by the Src oncoprotein induced gene expression through a Stat3-specific binding element (TTCCCGAA) of the C-reactive protein gene promoter. A naturally occurring splice variant of human Stat3 protein, Stat3beta, with a deletion in the C-terminal transactivation domain abolished this gene induction in a dominant negative manner. Expression of Stat3beta did not have any effect on a reporter construct based on the c-fos serum response element, which is not dependent on Stat3 signaling, indicating that Stat3beta does not nonspecifically inhibit other signaling pathways or Src function. Transfection of vectors expressing Stat3beta together with Src blocked cell transformation by Src as measured in a quantitative focus formation assay using NIH 3T3 cells. By contrast, Stat3beta had a much less pronounced effect on focus formation induced by the Ras oncoprotein, which does not activate Stat3 signaling. In addition, three independent clones of NIH 3T3 cells stably overexpressing Stat3beta were generated and characterized, demonstrating that Stat3beta overexpression does not have a toxic effect on cell viability. These Stat3beta-overexpressing clones were shown to be deficient in Stat3-mediated signaling and refractory to Src-induced cell transformation. We conclude that Stat3 activation by the Src oncoprotein leads to specific gene regulation and that Stat3 is one of the critical signaling pathways involved in Src oncogenesis. Our findings provide evidence that oncogenesis-associated activation of Stat3 signaling is part of the process of malignant transformation.},

abstract = {Interpretation of high-throughput biological data requires a knowledge of the design principles underlying the networks that sustain cellular functions. Of particular importance is the genetic network, a set of genes that interact through directed transcriptional regulation. Genes that exert a regulatory role encode dedicated transcription factors (hereafter referred to as regulating proteins) that can bind to specific DNA control regions of regulated genes to activate or inhibit their transcription. Regulated genes may themselves act in a regulatory manner, in which case they participate in a causal pathway. Looping pathways form feedback circuits. Because a gene can have several connections, circuits and pathways may crosslink and thus represent connected components. We have created a graph of 909 genetically or biochemically established interactions among 491 yeast genes. The number of regulating proteins per regulated gene has a narrow distribution with an exponential decay. The number of regulated genes per regulating protein has a broader distribution with a decay resembling a power law. Assuming in computer-generated graphs that gene connections fulfill these distributions but are otherwise random, the local clustering of connections and the number of short feedback circuits are largely underestimated. This deviation from randomness probably reflects functional constraints that include biosynthetic cost, response delay and differentiative and homeostatic regulation.},

Previous studies with defined combinations of ErbB receptors expressed in mammalian cells have helped elucidate specific biological responses for many of the recognized gene products that serve as ligands for these receptors. However, no study has examined the binding of these ligands in a defined experimental system. To address this issue, the relative binding affinities of the egf domains of eleven ErbB ligands were measured on six ErbB receptor combinations using a soluble receptor-ligand binding format. The ErbB2/4 heterodimer was shown to bind all ligands tested with moderate to very high affinity. In contrast, ErbB3 showed much more restrictive ligand binding specificity and measurable binding was observed only with heregulin, neuregulin2$\beta$, epiregulin and the synthetic heregulin/egf chimera, biregulin. These studies also revealed that ErbB2 preferentially enhances ligand binding to ErbB3 or ErbB4 and to a lesser degree to ErbB1. Copyright (C) 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.},

RAD51 protein is commonly expressed at high levels in cancer cells relative to their non-cancerous precursors. High levels of RAD51 expression can lead to the formation of genotoxic RAD51 protein complexes on undamaged chromatin. We developed a therapeutic approach that exploits this potentially toxic feature of malignancy, using compounds that stimulate the DNA binding activity of RAD51 to promote cancer cell death. A panel of immortalized cell lines was challenged with the RAD51-stimulatory compound RS-1. Resistance to RS-1 tended to occur in cells with higher levels of RAD54L and RAD54B, which are Swi2/Snf2-related translocases known to dissociate RAD51 filaments from double-stranded DNA. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, RS-1 induced lethality was accompanied by the formation of microscopically visible RAD51 nuclear protein foci occurring in the absence of any DNA-damaging treatment. Treatment with RS-1 promoted significant anti-tumor responses in a mouse model, providing proof of principle for this novel therapeutic strategy.},

In addition, it can com- bine sequences of highly different lengths, from short reads to assembled genomes. Finally, it ensures an effective data compression of highly re- dundant datasets. This thesis presents the development of a collection of methods, called Velvet, to convert a de Bruijn graph into a traditional assembly of contiguous sequences. The first step of the process, termed Tour Bus, re- moves sequencing errors and handles biological variations such as poly- morphisms. In its second part, Velvet aims to resolve repeats based on the available information, from low coverage long reads (Rock Band) or paired shotgun reads (Pebble). These methods were tested on various sim- ulations for precision and efficiency, then on control experimental datasets. De Bruijn graphs can also be used to detect and analyse structural variants from unassembled data. The final chapter of this thesis presents the results of collaborative work on the analysis of several experimental unassembled datasets.},

abstract = {Topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors applied in cancer therapy such as topotecan and irinotecan are derivatives of the natural alkaloid camptothecin (CPT). The mechanism of CPT poisoning of TOP1 rests on inhibition of the re-ligation function of the enzyme resulting in the stabilization of the TOP1-cleavable complex. In the presence of CPTs this enzyme-DNA complex impairs transcription and DNA replication, resulting in fork stalling and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in proliferating cells. As with most chemotherapeutics, intrinsic and acquired drug resistance represents a hurdle that limits the success of CPT therapy. Preclinical data indicate that resistance to CPT-based drugs might be caused by factors such as (a) poor drug accumulation in the tumor, (b) high rate of drug efflux, (c) mutations in TOP1 leading to failure in CPT docking, or (d) altered signaling triggered by the drug-TOP1-DNA complex, (e) expression of DNA repair proteins, and (f) failure to activate cell death pathways. This review will focus on the issues (d-f). We discuss degradation of TOP1 as part of the repair pathway in the processing of TOP1 associated DNA damage, give a summary of proteins involved in repair of CPT-induced replication mediated DSB, and highlight the role of p53 and inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), particularly XIAP and survivin, in cancer cell resistance to CPT-like chemotherapeutics. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Interestingly, this complex also specifically binds to cis-acting regulatory sequences of viral positive-strand RNA genomes promoting their translation and subsequent recruitment from translation to replication. Yet, how the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex regulates these two processes remains elusive. Here, we show that Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex acts differentially in these processes. By using a collection of well-characterized lsm1 mutant alleles and a system that allows the replication of Brome mosaic virus (BMV) in yeast we show that the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex integrity is essential for both, translation and recruitment. However, the intrinsic RNA-binding ability of the complex is only required for translation. Consistent with an RNA-binding-independent function of the Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex on BMV RNA recruitment, we show that the BMV 1a protein, the sole viral protein required for recruitment, interacts with this complex in an RNA-independent manner. Together, these results support a model wherein Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex binds consecutively to BMV RNA regulatory sequences and the 1a protein to promote viral RNA translation and later recruitment out of the host translation machinery to the viral replication complexes.},

abstract = {Nudix hydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphates linked to other moieties, X, and contain the sequence motif or Nudix box, GX5EX7REUXEEXGU. The mechanisms of Nudix hydrolases are highly diverse in the position on the substrate at which nucleophilic substitution occurs, and in the number of required divalent cations. While most proceed by associative nucleophilic substitutions by water at specific internal phosphorus atoms of a diphosphate or polyphosphate chain, members of the GDP-mannose hydrolase sub-family catalyze dissociative nucleophilic substitutions, by water, at carbon. The site of substitution is likely determined by the positions of the general base and the entering water. The rate accelerations or catalytic powers of Nudix hydrolases range from 109- to 1012-fold. The reactions are accelerated 103-105-fold by general base catalysis by a glutamate residue within, or beyond the Nudix box, or by a histidine beyond the Nudix box. Lewis acid catalysis, which contributes ≥103-105-fold to the rate acceleration, is provided by one, two, or three divalent cations. One divalent cation is coordinated by two or three conserved residues of the Nudix box, the initial glycine and one or two glutamate residues, together with a remote glutamate or glutamine ligand from beyond the Nudix box. Some Nudix enzymes require one (MutT) or two additional divalent cations (Ap4AP), to neutralize the charge of the polyphosphate chain, to help orient the attacking hydroxide or oxide nucleophile, and/or to facilitate the departure of the anionic leaving group. Additional catalysis (10-103-fold) is provided by the cationic side chains of lysine and arginine residues and by H-bond donation by tyrosine residues, to orient the general base, or to promote the departure of the leaving group. The overall rate accelerations can be explained by both independent and cooperative effects of these catalytic components. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We discuss studies that investigate the roles of the perirhinal cortex and the hippocampus in recognition memory using standard testing paradigms, and consider how these findings contribute to the ongoing debate about whether recognition memory is a single unitary process or multiple processes that can be dissociated anatomically and functionally. Due to the wide use of spontaneous tasks, the need for improved procedures that reduce animal use is acknowledged, with multiple trial paradigms discussed as a novel way of reducing variability and animal numbers in these tasks. The importance of improving translation of animal models to humans is highlighted, with emphasis on a shift away from relying on the phenomenological experience of human subjects.},

Results: We introduce Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN) that share the appealing rule-based properties of Boolean networks, but are robust in the face of uncertainty. We show how the dynamics of these networks can be studied in the probabilistic context of Markov chains, with standard Boolean networks being special cases. Then, we discuss the relationship between PBNs and Bayesian networks-a family of graphical models that explicitly represent probabilistic relationships between variables. We show how probabilistic dependencies between a gene and its parent genes, constituting the basic building blocks of Bayesian networks, can be obtained from PBNs. Finally, we present methods for quantifying the influence of genes on other genes, within the context of PBNs. Examples illustrating the above concepts are presented throughout the paper.},

abstract = {Genome editing tools such as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated system (Cas) have been widely used to modify genes in model systems including animal zygotes and human cells, and hold tremendous promise for both basic research and clinical applications. To date, a serious knowledge gap remains in our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms in human early embryos, and in the efficiency and potential off-target effects of using technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 in human pre-implantation embryos. In this report, we used tripronuclear (3PN) zygotes to further investigate CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells. We found that CRISPR/Cas9 could effectively cleave the endogenous $\beta$-globin gene (HBB). However, the efficiency of homologous recombination directed repair (HDR) of HBB was low and the edited embryos were mosaic. Off-target cleavage was also apparent in these 3PN zygotes as revealed by the T7E1 assay and whole-exome sequencing. Furthermore, the endogenous delta-globin gene (HBD), which is homologous to HBB, competed with exogenous donor oligos to act as the repair template, leading to untoward mutations. Our data also indicated that repair of the HBB locus in these embryos occurred preferentially through the non-crossover HDR pathway. Taken together, our work highlights the pressing need to further improve the fidelity and specificity of the CRISPR/Cas9 platform, a prerequisite for any clinical applications of CRSIPR/Cas9-mediated editing.},

abstract = {. Biological systems form complex networks of interaction on several scales, ranging from the molecular to the ecosystem level. On the subcellular scale, interaction between genes and gene products (mRNAs, proteins) forms the basis of essential processes like signal transduction, cell metabolism or embryonic development. Recent experimental advances helped uncover the qualitative structure of many gene control networks, creating a surge of interest in the quantitative description of gene regulation. We give a brief description of the main frameworks and methods used in modeling gene regulatory networks, then focus on a recent model of the segment polarity genes of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The basis of this model is the known interactions between the products of the segment polarity genes, and the network topology these interactions form. The interactions between mRNAs and proteins are described as logical (Boolean) functions. The success in reproducing both wild type and mutant gene expression patterns suggests that the kinetic details of the interactions are not essential as long as the network of interactions is unperturbed. The model predicts the gene patterns for cases that were not yet studied experimentally, and implies a remarkable robustness toward changes in internal parameters, initial conditions and even some mutations. The success of this approach also suggests a wide applicability of real-topologybased Boolean modeling for gene regulatory networks. In cases when the information about the system is incomplete, Boolean modeling can verify the sufficiency of interactions and can propose ways to complete the network. After a coherent picture is obtained, more realistic kinetic models can be used to gain additional insights into the functioning of the system.},

abstract = {Aquaporins and aquaglyceroporins form the membrane channels that mediate fluxes of water and small solute molecules into and out of cells. Eukaryotes often use mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades for the intracellular signaling of stress. This study reveals an aquaglyceroporin being destabilized by direct MAPK phosphorylation and also a stress resistance being acquired through this channel loss. Hog1 MAPK is transiently activated in yeast exposed to high, toxic levels of acetic acid. This Hog1 then phosphorylates the plasma membrane aquaglyceroporin, Fps1, a phosphorylation that results in Fps1 becoming ubiquitinated and endocytosed and then degraded in the vacuole. As Fps1 is the membrane channel that facilitates passive diffusional flux of undissociated acetic acid into the cell, this loss downregulates such influx in low-pH cultures, where acetic acid (pKa, 4.75) is substantially undissociated. Consistent with this downregulation of the acid entry generating resistance, sensitivity to acetic acid is seen with diverse mutational defects that abolish endocytic removal of Fps1 from the plasma membrane (loss of Hog1, loss of the soluble domains of Fps1, a T231A S537A double mutation of Fps1 that prevents its in vivo phosphorylation, or mutations generating a general loss of endocytosis of cell surface proteins [doa4Delta and end3Delta]). Remarkably, targetting of Fps1 for degradation may be the major requirement for an active Hog1 in acetic acid resistance, since Hog1 is largely dispensable for such resistance when the cells lack Fps1. Evidence is presented that in unstressed cells, Hog1 exists in physical association with the N-terminal cytosolic domain of Fps1.},

Deletion is 2- to 8-fold more efficient than inversion, independent of the DNA ends structure. KU80 controls accurate rejoining, whereas in absence of KU mutagenic rejoining, particularly microhomology-mediated repair, occurs efficiently. In cells bearing both the NHEJ and a homologous recombination (HR) substrate containing a third I-SceI site, we show that NHEJ is at least 3.3-fold more efficient than HR, and translocation of the I-SceI fragment from the NHEJ substrate locus into the HR-I-SceI site can occur, but 50- to 100-fold less frequently than deletion. Deletions and translocations show both accurate and inaccurate rejoining, suggesting that they correspond to a mix of KU-dependent and KU-independent processes.

abstract = {Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine–threonine kinase that functions via two multiprotein complexes, namely mTORC1 and mTORC2, each characterized by different binding partners that confer separate functions. mTORC1 function is tightly regulated by PI3-K/Akt and is sensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is sensitive to growth factors, not nutrients, and is associated with rapamycin-insensitivity. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis and cell growth through downstream molecules: 4E-BP1 (also called EIF4E-BP1) and S6K. Also, mTORC2 is thought to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt and SGK. Recent evidence has suggested that mTORC2 may play an important role in maintenance of normal as well as cancer cells by virtue of its association with ribosomes, which may be involved in metabolic regulation of the cell. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogs known as rapalogues, such as RAD001 (everolimus) and CCI-779 (temsirolimus), suppress mTOR activity through an allosteric mechanism that acts at a distance from the ATP-catalytic binding site, and are considered incomplete inhibitors. Moreover, these compounds suppress mTORC1-mediated S6K activation, thereby blocking a negative feedback loop, leading to activation of mitogenic pathways promoting cell survival and growth. Consequently, mTOR is a suitable target of therapy in cancer treatments. However, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. In recent years, new pharmacologic agents have been developed which can inhibit these complexes via ATP-binding mechanism, or dual inhibition of the canonical PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These compounds include WYE-354, KU-003679, PI-103, Torin1, and Torin2, which can target both complexes or serve as a dual inhibitor for PI3-K/mTOR. This investigation describes the mechanism of action of pharmacological agents that effectively target mTORC1 and mTORC2 resulting in suppression of growth, proliferation, and migration of tumor and cancer stem cells.},

abstract = {Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in certain cancers is well established. There is growing evidence that epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) in a phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner, but it is not yet clear which Akt isoforms are involved in this signal transduction pathway. We investigated the functional regulation of three Akt isoforms, Akt1/PKBalpha, Akt2/PKBbeta, and Akt3/PKBgamma, in esophageal cancer cells where EGFR is frequently overexpressed. Upon EGF simulation, phosphorylation of Akt1 at the Ser-473 residue was remarkably induced. This result was corroborated by in vitro Akt kinase assays using glycogen synthase kinase 3beta as the substrate. PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, significantly blocked the Akt kinase activity induced by EGF. Akt2 activity was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Robust activation of Akt2 by EGF was observed in some cell lines in a PI3K-dependent manner. EGF-induced Akt3 activation was demonstrated by Ser-472 phosphorylation of Akt3 but in a restrictive fashion. In aggregate, EGF-mediated activation of Akt isoforms is overlapping and distinctive. The mechanism by which EGFR recruits the PI3K/Akt pathway was in part differentially regulated at the level of Ras but independent of heterodimerization of EGFR with either ErbB2 or ErbB3 based upon functional dissection of pathways in esophageal cancer cell lines.},

TSC1 and TSC2 proteins form a physical and functional complex in vivo. Here, we show that TSC1-TSC2 inhibits the p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (an activator of translation) and activates the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, an inhibitor of translational initiation). These functions of TSC1-TSC2 are mediated by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, TSC2 is directly phosphorylated by Akt, which is involved in stimulating cell growth and is activated by growth stimulating signals, such as insulin. TSC2 is inactivated by Akt-dependent phosphorylation, which destabilizes TSC2 and disrupts its interaction with TSC1. Our data indicate a molecular mechanism for TSC2 in insulin signalling, tumour suppressor functions and in the inhibition of cell growth.},

abstract = {Cancerogenesis is driven by mutations leading to aberrant functioning of a complex network of molecular interactions and simultaneously affecting multiple cellular functions. Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global and detailed reconstructions of signalling networks amenable for computational analysis. We present here the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), an interactive and comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer. The resource includes tools for map navigation, visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of signalling network maps. Constructing and updating ACSN involves careful manual curation of molecular biology literature and participation of experts in the corresponding fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN is completely original and covers major mechanisms involved in cancer progression, including DNA repair, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle, EMT and cell motility. Cell signalling mechanisms are depicted in detail, together creating a seamless 'geographic-like' map of molecular interactions frequently deregulated in cancer. The map is browsable using NaviCell web interface using the Google Maps engine and semantic zooming principle. The associated web-blog provides a forum for commenting and curating the ACSN content. ACSN allows uploading heterogeneous omics data from users on top of the maps for visualization and performing functional analyses. We suggest several scenarios for ACSN application in cancer research, particularly for visualizing high-throughput data, starting from small interfering RNA-based screening results or mutation frequencies to innovative ways of exploring transcriptomes and phosphoproteomes. Integration and analysis of these data in the context of ACSN may help interpret their biological significance and formulate mechanistic hypotheses. ACSN may also support patient stratification, prediction of treatment response and resistance to cancer drugs, as well as design of novel treatment strategies.},

Aquaporins contribute to osmotic adjustment by facilitating transport of water or solutes across membranes. The tonoplastic water channel BobTIP1;1 (original name BobTIP26-1) genes are upregulated during dessication stress in cauliflower meristematic tissue. To investigate the physiological importance of BobTIP1;1, we expressed it in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae osmosensitive mutant fps1$\Delta$. We showed that the defect in the yeast glycerol plasma membrane transporter is complemented by a plant cDNA encoding the aquaporin BobTIP1;1 which is localized in the vacuolar membrane of the complemented yeast cells. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a plant aquaporin for which localization in the vacuolar membrane of yeast cells is related to an osmoresistant phenotype under hypo-osmotic shock. {\textcopyright} 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

abstract = {One of the main mechanisms of messenger RNA degradation in eukaryotes occurs by deadenylation-dependent decapping which leads to 5'-to-3' decay. A family of Sm-like (Lsm) proteins has been identified, members of which contain the 'Sm' sequence motif, form a complex with U6 small nuclear RNA and are required for pre-mRNA splicing. Here we show that mutations in seven yeast Lsm proteins (Lsm1-Lsm7) also lead to inhibition of mRNA decapping. In addition, the Lsm1-Lsm7 proteins co-immunoprecipitate with the mRNA decapping enzyme (Dcp1), a decapping activator (Pat1/Mrt1) and with mRNA. This indicates that the Lsm proteins may promote decapping by interactions with the mRNA and the decapping machinery. In addition, the Lsm complex that functions in mRNA decay appears to be distinct from the U6-associated Lsm complex, indicating that Lsm proteins form specific complexes that affect different aspects of mRNA metabolism.},

None of the mutations studied was able to fully overcome the wild-type hypoxic response. Deletion of the hap1 gene changed the expression profiles of individual open reading frames (ORFs) under both aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Major changes associated with rox3 deletion were related to the hypoxic activation. Rox3 also caused a repressor effect (oxygen-independent) on a subset of genes related to subtelomeric proteins. With regard to the effect brought about by the deletion of rox1 and srb10, correspondence cluster analysis revealed that the transcriptome profile in aerobic conditions is very similar in the wild-type and both deletion strains. In contrast, however, differences were found during hypoxia between the subgroup formed by wild-type and the Drox1 deletant compared with the Dsrb10 deletant. An analysis of selected ORFs responding to hypoxia, in association with a dependence on the regulatory factors studied, made it possible to iden- tify the clusters that are related to different regulatory circuits},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Mathematical modeling is used as a Systems Biology tool to answer biological questions, and more precisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and predict the effect of perturbations. This article presents an algorithm for modeling biological networks in a discrete framework with continuous time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nBACKGROUND: There exist two major types of mathematical modeling approaches: (1) quantitative modeling, representing various chemical species concentrations by real numbers, mainly based on differential equations and chemical kinetics formalism; (2) and qualitative modeling, representing chemical species concentrations or activities by a finite set of discrete values. Both approaches answer particular (and often different) biological questions. Qualitative modeling approach permits a simple and less detailed description of the biological systems, efficiently describes stable state identification but remains inconvenient in describing the transient kinetics leading to these states. In this context, time is represented by discrete steps. Quantitative modeling, on the other hand, can describe more accurately the dynamical behavior of biological processes as it follows the evolution of concentration or activities of chemical species as a function of time, but requires an important amount of information on the parameters difficult to find in the literature.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we propose a modeling framework based on a qualitative approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The algorithm presented in this article fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative modeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean state space. In order to describe the temporal evolution of the biological process we wish to model, we explicitly specify the transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that can be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set of ordinary differential equations on probability distributions. We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system by applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) on the Boolean state space. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes the temporal evolution of probability distributions and estimates stationary distributions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Applications of the Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo are demonstrated for three qualitative models: a toy model, a published model of p53/Mdm2 interaction and a published model of the mammalian cell cycle. Our approach allows to describe kinetic phenomena which were difficult to handle in the original models. In particular, transient effects are represented by time dependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell populations.},

abstract = {DNA helicases have essential roles in nucleic acid metabolism by facilitating cellular processes including replication, recombination, DNA repair, and transcription. The vital roles of helicases in these pathways are reflected by their emerging importance in the maintenance of genomic stability. Recently, a number of human diseases with cancer predisposition have been shown to be genetically linked to a specific helicase defect. This has led researchers to further investigate the roles of helicases in cancer biology, and to study the efficacy of targeting human DNA helicases for anti-cancer drug treatment. Helicase-specific inhibition in malignant cells may compromise the high proliferation rates of cancerous tissues. The role of RecQ helicases in response to replicational stress suggests a molecular target for selectively eliminating malignant tumor cells by a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. Alternate DNA secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes that may form in regulatory regions of oncogenes or G-rich telomere sequences are potential targets for cancer therapy since these sequence-specific structures are proposed to affect gene expression and telomerase activation, respectively. Small molecule inhibitors of G-quadruplex helicases may be used to regulate cell cycle progression by modulating promotor activation or disrupting telomere maintenance, important processes of cellular transformation. The design of small molecules which deter helicase function at telomeres may provide a molecular target since telomerase activity is necessary for the proliferation of numerous immortal cells. Although evidence suggests that helicases are specifically inhibited by certain DNA binding compounds, another area of promise in anti-cancer therapy is siRNA technology. Specific knockdown of helicase expression can be utilized as a means to sensitize oncogenic proliferating cell lines. This review will address these topics in detail and summarize the current avenues of research in anti-cancer therapy targeting helicases through small molecule inhibitors of DNA-protein complexes, DNA binding drugs, or down-regulation of helicase gene expression.},

abstract = {Background: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. Results: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. Conclusion: ARACNE shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.},

Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). Using this functionality we developed a transcriptional activation-based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding of sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared it with the off-target activity of transcription activator-like (TALs) effectors. Our results reveal that specificity profiles are sgRNA dependent, and that sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and 18-mer TAL effectors can potentially tolerate 1-3 and 1-2 target mismatches, respectively. By engineering a requirement for cooperativity through offset nicking for genome editing or through multiple synergistic sgRNAs for robust transcriptional activation, we suggest methods to mitigate off-target phenomena. Our results expand the versatility of the sgRNA:Cas9 tool and highlight the critical need to engineer improved specificity.},

Mathematical modeling can be a tool to gain an insight into such processes. Detailed biochemical modeling provides deep understanding, but does not scale well above relatively a few proteins. In contrast, logic modeling can be used where the biochemical knowledge of the system is sparse and, because it is parameter free (or, at most, uses relatively a few parameters), it scales well to large networks that can be derived by manual curation or retrieved from public databases. Here, we present an overview of logic modeling formalisms in the context of training logic models to data, and specifically the different approaches to modeling qualitative to quantitative data (state) and dynamics (time) of signal transduction. We use a toy model of signal transduction to illustrate how different logic formalisms (Boolean, fuzzy logic and differential equations) treat state and time. Different formalisms allow for different features of the data to be captured, at the cost of extra requirements in terms of computational power and data quality and quantity. Through this demonstration, the assumptions behind each formalism are discussed, as well as their advantages and disadvantages and possible future developments.},

abstract = {Numerous ecological and evolutionary processes are thought to play a role in maintaining the high plant species diversity of tropical forests. An understanding of the phylogenetic structure of an ecological community can provide insights into the relative importance of different processes structuring that community. The objectives of this study were to measure the phylogenetic structure of Neotropical forest tree communities in the Forest Dynamics Plot (FDP) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to determine how the phylogenetic structure of tree communities varied among spatial scales and habitats within the FDP, and to study the effects of null-model choice on estimates of community phylogenetic structure. We measured community phylogenetic structure for tree species occurring together in quadrats ranging in size from 10 x 10 m to 100 X 100 m in the FDP. We estimated phylogenetic structure by comparing observed phylogenetic distances among species to the distribution of phylogenetic distances for null communities generated using two different null models. A null model that did not maintain observed species occurrence frequencies tended to find nonrandom community phylogenetic structure, even for random data. Using a null model that maintained observed species frequencies in null communities, the average phylogenetic structure of tree communities in the FDP was close to random at all spatial scales examined, but more quadrats than expected contained species that were phylogenetically clustered or overdispersed, and phylogenetic structure varied among habitats. In young forests and plateau habitats, communities were phylogenetically clustered, meaning that trees were more closely related to their neighbors than expected, while communities in swamp and slope habitats were phylogenetically overdispersed, meaning that trees were more distantly related to their neighbors than expected. Phylogenetic clustering suggests the importance of environmental filtering of phylogenetically conserved traits in young forests and plateau habitats, but the phylogenetic overdispersion observed in other habitats has several possible explanations, including variation in the strength of ecological processes among habitats or the phylogenetic history of niches, traits, and habitat associations. Future studies will need to include information on species traits in order to explain the variation in phylogenetic structure among habitats in tropical forests.},

abstract = {Conceptual modeling is an important task undertaken during the systems development process to build a representation of those features of an application domain that are important to stakeholders. In spite of its importance, however, substantial evidence exists to show that it is not done well. Designers often provide incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent representations of domain features in the conceptual models they prepare. Users often have difficulty understanding the meaning inherent in a conceptual model.  In this paper, we investigate the proposition that part of the difficulties that stakeholders experience with conceptual modeling arises when a conceptual modeling grammar or a representation produced using the grammar lacks ontological clarity. Lack of ontological clarity arises when a one-one mapping does not exist between conceptual modeling constructs and real-world constructs. For example, the grammatical construct of an entity is used to represent both things and events in the real world.  Specifically, we focus on the grammatical construct of a relationship with attributes, which is often used in entity-relationship modeling. We argue that use of this construct produces ontologically unclear representations of a domain. We also report results from an experiment we undertook where we investigated the impact of using relationships with attributes in conceptual modeling representations on the problem-solving performance of users of these representations. Consistent with our predictions, we found that using relationships with attributes undermined problem-solving performance in unfamiliar domains. Contrary to our predictions, however, their use did not undermine problem-solving performance in familiar domains.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For the development of genome assembly tools, some comprehensive and efficiently computable validation measures are required to assess the quality of the assembly. The mostly used N50 measure summarizes the assembly results by the length of the scaffold (or contig) overlapping the midpoint of the length-order concatenation of scaffolds (contigs). Especially for scaffold assemblies it is non-trivial to combine a correctness measure to the N50 values, and the current methods for doing this are rather involved.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a simple but rigorous normalized N50 assembly metric that combines N50 with such a correctness measure; assembly is split into as many parts as necessary to align each part to the reference. For scalability, we first compute maximal local approximate matches between scaffolds and reference in distributed manner, and then proceed with co-linear chaining to find a global alignment. Best alignment is removed from the scaffold and the process is iterated with the remaining scaffold content in order to split the scaffold into correctly aligning parts. The proposed normalized N50 metric is then the N50 value computed for the final correctly aligning parts. As a side result of independent interest, we show how to modify co-linear chaining to restrict gaps to produce a more sensible global alignment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We propose and implement a comprehensive and efficient approach to compute a metric that summarizes scaffold assembly correctness and length. Our implementation can be downloaded from http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/scaffold/normalizedN50/.},

abstract = {Sm-like (Lsm) proteins function in a variety of RNA-processing events. In yeast, the Lsm2-Lsm8 complex binds and stabilizes the spliceosomal U6 snRNA, whereas the Lsm1-Lsm7 complex functions in mRNA decay. Here we report that a third Lsm complex, consisting of Lsm2-Lsm7 proteins, associates with snR5, a box H/ACA snoRNA that functions to guide site-specific pseudouridylation of rRNA. Experiments in which the binding of Lsm proteins to snR5 was reconstituted in vitro reveal that the 3' end of snR5 is critical for Lsm protein recognition. Glycerol gradient sedimentation and sequential immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that the Lsm protein-snR5 complex is partly distinct from the complex formed by snR5 RNA with the box H/ACA proteins Gar1p and Nhp2p. Consistent with a separate complex, Lsm proteins are not required for the function of snR5 in pseudouridylation of rRNA. We demonstrate that in addition to their known nuclear and cytoplasmic locations, Lsm proteins are present in nucleoli. Taken together with previous findings that a small fraction of pre-RNase P RNA associates with Lsm2-Lsm7, our experiments suggest that an Lsm2-Lsm7 protein complex resides in nucleoli, contributing to the biogenesis or function of specific snoRNAs.},

abstract = {The STAT proteins (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription), were identified in the last decade as transcription factors which were critical in mediating virtually all cytokine driven signaling. These proteins are latent in the cytoplasm and become activated through tyrosine phosphorylation which typically occurs through cytokine receptor associated kinases (JAKs) or growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently a number of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (for example src and abl) have been found to cause STAT phosphorylation. Phosphorylated STATs form homo- or hetero-dimers, enter the nucleus and working coordinately with other transcriptional co-activators or transcription factors lead to increased transcriptional initiation. In normal cells and in animals, ligand dependent activation of the STATs is a transient process, lasting for several minutes to several hours. In contrast, in many cancerous cell lines and tumors, where growth factor dysregulation is frequently at the heart of cellular transformation, the STAT proteins (in particular Stats 1, 3 and 5) are persistently tyrosine phosphorylated or activated. The importance of STAT activation to growth control in experiments using anti-sense molecules or dominant negative STAT protein encoding constructs performed in cell lines or studies in animals lacking specific STATs strongly indicate that STATs play an important role in controlling cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Stat1 plays an important role in growth arrest, in promoting apoptosis and is implicated as a tumor suppressor; while Stats 3 and 5 are involved in promoting cell cycle progression and cellular transformation and preventing apoptosis. Many questions remain including: (1) a better understanding of how the STAT proteins through association with other factors increase transcription initiation; (2) a more complete definition of the sets of genes which are activated by different STATs and (3) how these sets of activated genes differ as a function of cell type. Finally, in the context of many cancers, where STATs are frequently persistently activated, an understanding of the mechanisms leading to their constitutive activation and defining the potential importance of persistent STAT activation in human tumorigenesis remains.

abstract = {Interactions between short modified peptide motifs and modular protein domains are central events in cell signal-transduction. We determined interaction partners to all cytosolic tyrosine residues of the four members of the ErbB-receptor family in an unbiased fashion by quantitative proteomics using pull-down experiments with pairs of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated synthetic peptides. Each receptor had characteristic preferences for interacting proteins and most interaction partners had multiple binding sites on each receptor. EGFR and ErbB4 had several docking sites for Grb2, while ErbB3 was characterized by six binding sites for PI3K. We identified STAT5 as a direct binding partner to EGFR and ErbB4 and discovered new recognition motifs for Shc and STAT5. The overall pattern of interaction partners of EGFR and ErbB4 suggests similar roles during signaling through their respective ligands. Phosphorylation kinetics of several tyrosine resides was measured by mass spectrometry and correlated with interaction partner preference. Our results demonstrate that system-wide mapping of peptide-protein interactions sites is possible, and suggest shared and unique roles of ErbB-receptor family members in downstream signaling.},

abstract = {Natively unfolded proteins play key roles in normal and pathological biochemical  processes. Despite their importance for function, this category of proteins remains beyond the reach of classical structural biology because of their inherent conformational heterogeneity. We present a description of the intrinsic conformational sampling of unfolded proteins based on residue-specific /Psi propensities from loop regions of a folded protein database and simple volume exclusion. This approach is used to propose a structural model of the 57-aa, natively disordered region of the nucleocapsid-binding domain of Sendai virus phosphoprotein. Structural ensembles obeying these simple rules of conformational sampling are used to simulate averaged residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) and small-angle x-ray scattering data. This protein is particularly informative because RDC data from the equally sized folded and unfolded domains both report on the unstructured region, allowing a quantitative analysis of the degree of order present in this part of the protein. Close agreement between experimental and simulated RDC and small-angle x-ray scattering data validates this simple model of conformational sampling, providing a precise description of local structure and dynamics and average dimensions of the ensemble of sampled structures. RDC data from two urea-unfolded systems are also closely reproduced. The demonstration that conformational behavior of unfolded proteins can be accurately predicted from the primary sequence by using a simple set of rules has important consequences for our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the unstructured state.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Most quantitative measures of phenotypic traits represent macroscopic contributions of large numbers of cells. Yet, cells of a tissue do not behave similarly, and molecular studies on several organisms have shown that regulations can be highly stochastic, sometimes generating diversified cellular phenotypes within tissues. Phenotypic noise, defined here as trait variability among isogenic cells of the same type and sharing a common environment, has therefore received a lot of attention. Given the potential fitness advantage provided by phenotypic noise in fluctuating environments, the possibility that it is directly subjected to evolutionary selection is being considered. For selection to act, phenotypic noise must differ between contemporary genotypes. Whether this is the case or not remains, however, unclear because phenotypic noise has very rarely been quantified in natural populations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:Using automated image analysis, we describe here the phenotypic diversity of S. cerevisiae morphology at single-cell resolution. We profiled hundreds of quantitative traits in more than 1,000 cells of 37 natural strains, which represent various geographical and ecological origins of the species. We observed abundant trait variation between strains, with no correlation with their ecological origin or population history. Phenotypic noise strongly depended on the strain background. Noise variation was largely trait-specific (specific strains showing elevated noise for subset of traits) but also global (a few strains displaying elevated noise for many unrelated traits).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS:Our results demonstrate that phenotypic noise does differ quantitatively between natural populations. This supports the possibility that, if noise is adaptive, microevolution may tune it in the wild. This tuning may happen on specific traits or by varying the degree of global phenotypic buffering.},

Anti-SHC antibodies recognized three proteins of 46, 52, and 66 kd in a wide range of mammalian cell lines. These SHC proteins complexed with and were phosphorylated by activated epidermal growth factor receptor. The physical association of SHC proteins with activated receptors was recreated in vitro by using a bacterially expressed SHC SH2 domain. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts that constitutively overexpressed SHC acquired a transformed phenotype in culture and formed tumors in nude mice. These results suggest that the SHC gene products couple activated growth factor receptors to a signaling pathway that regulates the proliferation of mammalian cells. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Character data that are consistent with one phylogenetic hypothesis produce tree-length distributions that are highly skewed to the left, whereas character data consistent with many phylogenetic hypotheses produce more symmetrical tree-length distributions that cannot be distinguished from tree-length distributions produced by random character data. The relationship between the skewness of the tree-length distribution, as measured by the g1 statistic, and the amount of phylogenetic signal varies depending on tree topology, the proportion of the sequence that is informative (e.g., informative change at only the first codon position as opposed to informative change at the first and second codon positions), and the number of sequence data. However, in all simulations that produced tree-length distributions that were significant at the 1{\%} level under Hillis's (1991, in Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences [M. M. Miyamoto and J. Cracraft, eds.], Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford, England [in press]) statistical test, the real tree was very close to or was the most parsimonious tree. Conversely, in trees with nonsignificantly skewed tree-length distributions, the real tree could be almost anywhere in the distribution. However, the real tree tended to be closer to the most parsimonious tree than would be expected at random. This study suggests that tree-length distribution skewness provides a useful criterion for judging the phylogenetic information content of character data.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling of biological processes provides deep insights into complex cellular systems. While quantitative and continuous models such as differential equations have been widely used, their use is obstructed in systems wherein the knowledge of mechanistic details and kinetic parameters is scarce. On the other hand, a wealth of molecular level qualitative data on individual components and interactions can be obtained from the experimental literature and high-throughput technologies, making qualitative approaches such as Boolean network modeling extremely useful. In this paper, we build on our research to provide a methodology overview of Boolean modeling in systems biology, including Boolean dynamic modeling of cellular networks, attractor analysis of Boolean dynamic models, as well as inferring biological regulatory mechanisms from high-throughput data using Boolean models. We finally demonstrate how Boolean models can be applied to perform the structural analysis of cellular networks. This overview aims to acquaint life science researchers with the basic steps of Boolean modeling and its applications in several areas of systems biology.},

DMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and a shortened life span, and there is no effective treatment. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to correct the dystrophin gene (Dmd) mutation in the germline of mdx mice, a model for DMD, and then monitored muscle structure and function. Genome editing produced genetically mosaic animals containing 2 to 100{\%} correction of the Dmd gene. The degree of muscle phenotypic rescue in mosaic mice exceeded the efficiency of gene correction, likely reflecting an advantage of the corrected cells and their contribution to regenerating muscle. With the anticipated technological advances that will facilitate genome editing of postnatal somatic cells, this strategy may one day allow correction of disease-causing mutations in the muscle tissue of patients with DMD.},

abstract = {The W191G cavity of cytochrome c peroxidase is useful as a model system for introducing small molecule oxidation in an artificially created cavity. A set of small, cyclic, organic cations was previously shown to bind in the buried, solvent-filled pocket created by the W191G mutation. We docked these ligands and a set of non-binders in the W191G cavity using AutoDock 3.0. For the ligands, we compared docking predictions with experimentally determined binding energies and X-ray crystal structure complexes. For the ligands, predicted binding energies differed from measured values by +/- 0.8 kcal/mol. For most ligands, the docking simulation clearly predicted a single binding mode that matched the crystallographic binding mode within 1.0 A RMSD. For 2 ligands, where the docking procedure yielded an ambiguous result, solutions matching the crystallographic result could be obtained by including an additional crystallographically observed water molecule in the protein model. For the remaining 2 ligands, docking indicated multiple binding modes, consistent with the original electron density, suggesting disordered binding of these ligands. Visual inspection of the atomic affinity grid maps used in docking calculations revealed two patches of high affinity for hydrogen bond donating groups. Multiple solutions are predicted as these two sites compete for polar hydrogens in the ligand during the docking simulation. Ligands could be distinguished, to some extent, from non-binders using a combination of two trends: predicted binding energy and level of clustering. In summary, AutoDock 3.0 appears to be useful in predicting key structural and energetic features of ligand binding in the W191G cavity.},

To probe the extent of these interactions and delineate their functional contributions, we quantified the Saccharomyces amino acid metabolome and its response to systematic gene deletion. Over one-third of coding genes, in particular those important for chromatin dynamics, translation, and transport, contribute to biosynthetic metabolism. Specific amino acid signatures characterize genes of similar function. This enabled us to exploit functional metabolomics to connect metabolic regulators to their effectors, as exemplified by TORC1, whose inhibition in exponentially growing cells is shown to match an interruption in endomembrane transport. Providing orthogonal information compared to physical and genetic interaction networks, metabolomic signatures cluster more than half of the so far uncharacterized yeast genes and provide functional annotation for them. A major part of coding genes is therefore participating in gene-metabolism interactions that expose the metabolism regulatory network and enable access to an underexplored space in gene function.},

Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide 'omics' studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components.

abstract = {Autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases provides binding sites for signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. We determined the binding sites of Shc, SH2-containing adaptor protein, within epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors, using Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing EGF receptor mutants in which autophosphorylation sites, either alone or in combination, were replaced by phenylalanine. Binding of Shc to EGF receptor mutants lacking single tyrosine residues at 1148 or 1173 decreased by approximately 60 or approximately 15{\%}, respectively, whereas other single point mutants bound the wild-type level of Shc. Binding of Shc markedly decreased in mutants lacking both tyrosine residues at 1148 and 1173. In peptide inhibition assay, phosphorylated nonameric peptide representing tyrosine 1148, DNPDpYQQDF, but not pentameric peptide, pYQQDF, inhibited the binding of glutathione S-transferase-Shc SH2 domain fusion protein to in vitro autophosphorylated EGF receptors, suggesting that N-terminal sequences adjacent to phosphotyrosine are necessary for the association of Shc. Based on results of peptide inhibition assays in which phosphorylated peptides representing tyrosines 992, 1148, and 1173 inhibited Shc binding to the receptor, we constructed another EGF receptor mutant in which one of these tyrosine residues was retained. The amount of Shc bound to mutant receptors retaining tyrosines 1148, 1173, or 992 was approximately 80, approximately 40, or approximately 10{\%} of wild-type level, respectively. These results indicate that tyrosine 1148 of activated human EGF receptors is a major binding site of Shc and tyrosine 1173 is a secondary binding site in intact cells.},

abstract = {Topoisomerase II (Top2) is the essential protein that resolves DNA catenations. When Top2 is inactivated, mitotic catastrophe results from massive entanglement of chromosomes. Top2 is also the target of many first-line anticancer drugs, the so-called Top2 poisons. Often, tumors become resistant to these drugs by acquiring hypomorphic mutations in the genes encoding Top2. Here, we have compared the cell cycle and nuclear segregation of two coisogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains carrying top2 thermosensitive alleles that differ in their resistance to Top2 poisons: the broadly-used poison-sensitive top2-4 and the poison-resistant top2-5 Furthermore, we have performed genome-scale Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analyses for both alleles under permissive conditions, chronic sublethal Top2 downregulation and acute, yet transient, Top2 inactivation. We find that slowing down mitotic progression, especially at the time of execution of the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), protects against Top2 deficiency. In all conditions, genetic protection was stronger in top2-5, and this correlated with cell biology experiments in this mutant whereby we observed destabilization of both chromatin and ultrafine anaphase bridges by execution of MEN and cytokinesis. Interestingly, whereas transient inactivation of the critical MEN driver Cdc15 partly suppressed top2-5 lethality, this was not the case when earlier steps within anaphase were disrupted; i.e., top2-5 cdc14-1 We discuss the basis of this difference and suggest that accelerated progression through mitosis may be a therapeutic strategy to hypersensitize cancer cells carrying hypomorphic mutations in TOP2.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis is moving towards considering pathway topology as a crucial feature. Pathway elements are complex entities such as protein complexes, gene family members and chemical compounds. The conversion of pathway topology to a gene/protein networks (where nodes are a simple element like a gene/protein) is a critical and challenging task that enables topology-based gene set analyses.Unfortunately, currently available R/Bioconductor packages provide pathway networks only from single databases. They do not propagate signals through chemical compounds and do not differentiate between complexes and gene families.RESULTS: Here we present graphite, a Bioconductor package addressing these issues. Pathway information from four different databases is interpreted following specific biologically-driven rules that allow the reconstruction of gene-gene networks taking into account protein complexes, gene families and sensibly removing chemical compounds from the final graphs. The resulting networks represent a uniform resource for pathway analyses. Indeed, graphite provides easy access to three recently proposed topological methods. The graphite package is available as part of the Bioconductor software suite.CONCLUSIONS: graphite is an innovative package able to gather and make easily available the contents of the four major pathway databases. In the field of topological analysis graphite acts as a provider of biological information by reducing the pathway complexity considering the biological meaning of the pathway elements},

In S. cerevisiae, the key protein kinase, Hog1, coordinates the transcriptional induction of a variety of genes devoted to osmoadaptation and general stress protection. Depending on the promoter context, Hog1 can function through a variety of structurally unrelated transcription factors. Using chromatin precipitation assays, we discovered that the kinase itself becomes intimately linked with promoter regions during stress responses. This interaction is dependent on the presence of stress-mediating transcriptional activators. In turn, Hog1 modulates promoter association of at least one of these factors. Additional findings highlight the possibility that Hog1 constitutes an integral part of the upstream activation complex, perhaps targeting not only the activator but also components of the general transcription machinery.},

abstract = {Discrete dynamic models are a powerful tool for the understanding and modeling of large biological networks. Although a lot of progress has been made in developing analysis tools for these models, there is still a need to find approaches that can directly relate the network structure to its dynamics. Of special interest is identifying the stable patterns of activity, i.e., the attractors of the system. This is a problem for large networks, because the state space of the system increases exponentially with network size. In this work we present a novel network reduction approach that is based on finding network motifs that stabilize in a fixed state. Notably, we use a topological criterion to identify these motifs. Specifically, we find certain types of strongly connected components in a suitably expanded representation of the network. To test our method we apply it to a dynamic network model for a type of cytotoxic T cell cancer and to an ensemble of random Boolean networks of size up to 200. Our results show that our method goes beyond reducing the network and in most cases can actually predict the dynamical repertoire of the nodes (fixed states or oscillations) in the attractors of the system.},

In our previous studies, Shc was shown to be a substrate of the tyrosine kinase c-Src in vitro and in vivo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using green fluorescent protein-fusion Shc (GFP-Shc), we have shown that following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of A431 cells, all Shc isoforms were rapidly recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (within 5 min) and then redistributed to the cytoplasmic vesicle structures (in the next 10-20 min). Indirect immunofluorescent study demonstrated that all Shc isoforms co-localize with EGF receptor (EGFR) and activated c-Src in both plasma membranes and cytoplasmic vesicle structures. Our previous study has shown that EGF induces the indirect association of EGFR and c-Src and activation of c-Src in A431 cells. An immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that the EGFR-Src association and c-Src activation are augmented in cells expressing GFP-Shc P52 or P66, but not P46. In addition, P52 and P66, but not P46, are in association with EGFR-Src complex. We also found that EGFR and Shc can be dissociated from c-Src by the addition of a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the autophosphorylation site of c-Src. Interestingly, the peptide-induced dissociation of the complex was not affected by the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the peptide.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results demonstrated a dynamic subcellular movement of Shc in response to EGF, and suggested a hitherto unknown scheme whereby Shc can work not only as a substrate of c-Src but also as a mediator of the EGF-induced activation of c-Src in an isoform-specific manner.},

abstract = {All eukaryotic cells coordinate cell growth with the availability of nutrients in their environment. The mTOR protein kinase has emerged as a critical growth-control node, receiving stimulatory signals from Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) downstream from growth factors, as well as nutrient inputs in the form of amino-acid, glucose and oxygen availability. Notably, components of the Ras and PI(3)K signalling pathways are mutated in most human cancers. The preponderance of mutations in these interconnected pathways suggests that the loss of growth-control checkpoints and promotion of cell survival in nutrient-limited conditions may be an obligate event in tumorigenesis.},

The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an effi- cient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing allows the simultaneous disruption of five genes (Tet1, 2, 3, Sry, Uty - 8 alleles) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with high efficiency. Coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet1 and Tet2 into zygotes generated mice with bial- lelic mutations in both genes with an efficiency of 80{\%}. Finally, we show that coinjection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs with mutant oligos generated pre- cise point mutations simultaneously in two target genes. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system allows the one-step generation of animals carrying mutations in multiple genes, an approach that will greatly accel- erate the in vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions.},

Here, we report the development and successful application of a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome engineering of up to 5 different genomic loci in one transformation step in baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To assess the specificity of the tool we employed genome re-sequencing to screen for off-target sites in all single knock-out strains targeted by different gRNAs. This extensive analysis identified no more genome variants in CRISPR/Cas9 engineered strains compared to wild-type reference strains. We applied our genome engineering tool for an exploratory analysis of all possible single, double, triple, quadruple and quintuple gene disruption combinations to search for strains with high mevalonate production, a key intermediate for the industrially important isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. Even though we did not overexpress any genes in the mevalonate pathway, this analysis identified strains with mevalonate titers greater than 41-fold compared to the wild-type strain. Our findings illustrate the applicability of this highly specific and efficient multiplex genome engineering approach to accelerate functional genomics and metabolic engineering efforts.},

abstract = {Motivation: Models of discrete concurrent systems often lead to huge and complex state transition graphs that represent their dynamics. This makes difficult to analyse dynamical properties. In particular, for logical models of biological regulatory networks, it is of real interest to study attractors and their reachability from specific initial conditions, i.e. to assess the potential asymptotical behaviours of the system. Beyond the identification of the reachable attractors, we propose to quantify this reachability. Results: Relying on the structure of the state transition graph, we estimate the probability of each attractor reachable from a given initial condition or from a portion of the state space. First, we present a quasi-exact solution with an original algorithm called Firefront, based on the exhaustive exploration of the reachable state space. Then, we introduce an adapted version of Monte Carlo simulation algorithm, termed Avatar, better suited to larger models. Firefront and Avatar methods are validated and compared to other related approaches, using as test cases logical models of synthetic and biological networks. Availability: Both algorithms are implemented as Perl scripts that can be freely downloaded from http://compbio.igc.gulbenkian.pt/nmd/node/59 along with Supplementary Material.},

abstract = {Wnts are a large family of secreted glycoproteins that mediate bone development in the embryo and promote bone production in the adult. Autocrine Wnt signaling within tumor cells has been shown to promote tumorigenesis by enhancing tumor cell proliferation and survival. We recently demonstrated that prostate cancer cells (CaP) produce Wnts which act in a paracrine fashion to induce osteoblastic activity in CaP bone metastases. The ability of tumor-derived Wnts to influence bone development is regulated by multiple families of secreted antagonists including soluble frizzled related receptors (sFrp) and dickkopfs (DKK). CaP cells appear to produce DKK-1 early in the development of skeletal metastases, which masks osteogenic Wnts and thus favors an osteolytic environment at the metastatic site. As the metastases progresses, DKK-1 expression is lost allowing for a Wnt mediated osteoblastic response which predominates CaP boney lesions. Interestingly, blocking DKK-1 expression early in CaP metastasis prevents tumor establishment within the bone suggesting that osteolysis is a required first step in the development of CaP bone metastases. In this review, we discuss our data on the Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 in CaP bone metastasis in the context of current literature evidence that demonstrate that Wnt inhibitors can function as both tumor suppressors and tumor promoters. We provide a model that the affect of Wnt inhibitors on tumor development is dependent on the tumor micro-environment and suggest that DKK-1 is a switch which transitions CaP bone metastases from osteolytic to osteoblastic.},

Functional genomics projects offer a cost- effective means of greatly expanding the completeness of our regulatory models, and for some prokaryotic organisms they offer a means of learning accurate models that incorporate the majority of the genome. There are, however, several reasons to believe that regulatory network inference is beyond our current reach, such as (i) the combinatorics of the problem, (ii) factors we can't (or don't often) collect genome-wide measurements for and (iii) dynamics that elude cost-effective experimental designs. Recent works have demonstrated the ability to reconstruct large fractions of prokaryotic regulatory networks from compendiums of genomics data; they have also demonstrated that these global regulatory models can be used to predict the dynamics of the transcriptome.

Mathematical modeling of biological networks and processes has already greatly improved our understanding of many cellular processes. However, given the massive amount of qualitative and quantitative data currently produced and number of burning questions in health care and biotechnology needed to be solved is still in its early phases. The field requires novel approaches for abstraction, for modeling bioprocesses that follow different biochemical and biophysical rules, and for combining different modules into larger models that still allow realistic simulation with the computational power available today. We have identified and discussed currently most prominent problems in systems biology: (1) how to bridge different scales of modeling abstraction, (2) how to bridge the gap between topological and mechanistic modeling, and (3) how to bridge the wet and dry laboratory gap.

abstract = {Accurate chromosome segregation requires the execution and coordination of many processes during mitosis, including DNA replication, sister chromatid cohesion, and attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules via the kinetochore complex. Additional pathways are likely involved because faithful chromosome segregation also requires proteins that are not physically associated with the chromosome. Using kinetochore mutants as a starting point, we have identified genes with roles in chromosome stability by performing genome-wide screens employing synthetic genetic array methodology. Two genetic approaches (a series of synthetic lethal and synthetic dosage lethal screens) isolated 211 nonessential deletion mutants that were unable to tolerate defects in kinetochore function. Although synthetic lethality and synthetic dosage lethality are thought to be based upon similar genetic principles, we found that the majority of interactions associated with these two screens were nonoverlapping. To functionally characterize genes isolated in our screens, a secondary screen was performed to assess defects in chromosome segregation. Genes identified in the secondary screen were enriched for genes with known roles in chromosome segregation. We also uncovered genes with diverse functions, such as RCS1, which encodes an iron transcription factor. RCS1 was one of a small group of genes identified in all three screens, and we used genetic and cell biological assays to confirm that it is required for chromosome stability. Our study shows that systematic genetic screens are a powerful means to discover roles for uncharacterized genes and genes with alternative functions in chromosome maintenance that may not be discovered by using proteomics approaches.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more.Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

abstract = {The FoxO forkhead transcription factors FoxO4 (AFX), FoxO3a (FKHR.L1), and FoxO1a (FKHR) represent important physiological targets of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB) signaling. Overexpression or conditional activation of FoxO factors is able to antagonize many responses to constitutive PI3K/PKB activation including its effect on cellular proliferation. It was previously shown that the FoxO-induced cell cycle arrest is partially mediated by enhanced transcription and protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 (R. H. Medema, G. J. Kops, J. L. Bos, and B. M. Burgering, Nature 404:782-787, 2000). Here we have identified a p27kip1-independent mechanism that plays an important role in the antiproliferative effect of FoxO factors. Forced expression or conditional activation of FoxO factors leads to reduced protein expression of the D-type cyclins D1 and D2 and is associated with an impaired capacity of CDK4 to phosphorylate and inactivate the S-phase repressor pRb. Downregulation of D-type cyclins involves a transcriptional repression mechanism and does not require p27kip1 function. Ectopic expression of cyclin D1 can partially overcome FoxO factor-induced cell cycle arrest, demonstrating that downregulation of D-type cyclins represents a physiologically relevant mechanism of FoxO-induced cell cycle inhibition.},

abstract = {We describe a computational protocol for the ARACNE algorithm, an information-theoretic method for identifying transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray expression profile data. Similar to other algorithms, ARACNE predicts potential functional associations among genes, or novel functions for uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between gene products. However, based on biochemical validation, literature searches and DNA binding site enrichment analysis, ARACNE has also proven effective in identifying bona fide transcriptional targets, even in complex mammalian networks. Thus we envision that predictions made by ARACNE, especially when supplemented with prior knowledge or additional data sources, can provide appropriate hypotheses for the further investigation of cellular networks. While the examples in this protocol use only gene expression profile data, the algorithm's theoretical basis readily extends to a variety of other high-throughput measurements, such as pathway-specific or genome-wide proteomics, microRNA and metabolomics data. As these data become readily available, we expect that ARACNE might prove increasingly useful in elucidating the underlying interaction models. For a microarray data set containing approximately 10,000 probes, reconstructing the network around a single probe completes in several minutes using a desktop computer with a Pentium 4 processor. Reconstructing a genome-wide network generally requires a computational cluster, especially if the recommended bootstrapping procedure is used.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Shc is the adaptor protein that exists in three isoforms, P46, P52 and P66, and acts as a bridge between activated cell surface receptors and downstream signalling molecules which act in extracellular signal-regulated cell events such as cell cycle progression. In our previous studies, Shc was shown to be a substrate of the tyrosine kinase c-Src in vitro and in vivo.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using green fluorescent protein-fusion Shc (GFP-Shc), we have shown that following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of A431 cells, all Shc isoforms were rapidly recruited from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (within 5 min) and then redistributed to the cytoplasmic vesicle structures (in the next 10-20 min). Indirect immunofluorescent study demonstrated that all Shc isoforms co-localize with EGF receptor (EGFR) and activated c-Src in both plasma membranes and cytoplasmic vesicle structures. Our previous study has shown that EGF induces the indirect association of EGFR and c-Src and activation of c-Src in A431 cells. An immunoprecipitation study demonstrated that the EGFR-Src association and c-Src activation are augmented in cells expressing GFP-Shc P52 or P66, but not P46. In addition, P52 and P66, but not P46, are in association with EGFR-Src complex. We also found that EGFR and Shc can be dissociated from c-Src by the addition of a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the autophosphorylation site of c-Src. Interestingly, the peptide-induced dissociation of the complex was not affected by the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the peptide.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results demonstrated a dynamic subcellular movement of Shc in response to EGF, and suggested a hitherto unknown scheme whereby Shc can work not only as a substrate of c-Src but also as a mediator of the EGF-induced activation of c-Src in an isoform-specific manner.},

abstract = {Protein kinases are an important class of enzymes controlling virtually all cellular signaling pathways. Consequently, selective inhibitors of protein kinases have attracted significant interest as potential new drugs for many diseases. Computational methods, including molecular docking, have increasingly been used in the inhibitor design process [1]. We have considered several docking packages in order to strengthen our kinase inhibitor work with computational capabilities. In our experience, AutoDock offered a reasonable combination of accuracy and speed, as opposed to methods that specialize either in fast database searches or detailed and computationally intensive calculations. However, AutoDock did not perform well in cases where extensive hydrophobic contacts were involved, such as docking of SB203580 to its target protein kinase p38. Another shortcoming was a hydrogen bonding energy function, which underestimated the attraction component and, thus, did not allow for sufficiently accurate modeling of the key hydrogen bonds in the kinase-inhibitor complexes. We have modified the parameter set used to model hydrogen bonds, which increased the accuracy of AutoDock and appeared to be generally applicable to many kinase-inhibitor pairs without customization. Binding to largely hydrophobic sites, such as the active site of p38, was significantly improved by introducing a correction factor selectively affecting only carbon and hydrogen energy grids, thus, providing an effective, although approximate, treatment of solvation.},

abstract = {A genetic interaction occurs when the combination of two mutations leads to an unexpected phenotype. Screens for synthetic genetic interactions have been used extensively to identify genes whose products are functionally related. In particular, synthetic lethal genetic interactions often identify genes that buffer one another or impinge on the same essential pathway. For the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a method termed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis, which offers an efficient approach for the systematic construction of double mutants and enables a global analysis of synthetic genetic interactions. In a typical SGA screen, a query mutation is crossed to an ordered array of ∼5000 viable gene deletion mutants (representing ∼80{\%} of all yeast genes) such that meiotic progeny harboring both mutations can be scored for fitness defects. This approach can be extended to all ∼6000 genes through the use of yeast arrays containing mutants carrying conditional or hypomorphic alleles of essential genes. Estimating the fitness for the two single mutants and their corresponding double mutant enables a quantitative measurement of genetic interactions, distinguishing negative (synthetic lethal) and positive (within pathway and suppression) interactions. The profile of genetic interactions represents a rich phenotypic signature for each gene and clustering genetic interaction profiles group genes into functionally relevant pathways and complexes. This array-based approach automates yeast genetic analysis in general and can be easily adapted for a number of different genetic screens or combined with high-content screening systems to quantify the activity of specific reporters in genome-wide sets of single or more complex multiple mutant backgrounds. Comparison of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction profiles offers the potential to link bioactive compounds to their targets. Finally, we also developed an SGA system for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, providing another model system for comparative analysis of genetic networks and testing the conservation of genetic networks over millions of years of evolution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is highly regulated by environmental influences, and functionally implicated in behavioural responses to stress and antidepressants1–4. However, how adult-born neurons regulate dentate gyrus information processing to protect from stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour is unknown. Here we show in mice that neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress by inhibiting the activity of mature granule cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), a subregion that is implicated in mood regulation. We found that chemogenetic inhibition of adult-born neurons in the vDG promotes susceptibility to social defeat stress, whereas increasing neurogenesis confers resilience to chronic stress. By using in vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activity from large cell populations in the vDG, we show that increased neurogenesis results in a decrease in the activity of stress-responsive cells that are active preferentially during attacks or while mice explore anxiogenic environments. These effects on dentate gyrus activity are necessary and sufficient for stress resilience, as direct silencing of the vDG confers resilience whereas excitation promotes susceptibility. Our results suggest that the activity of the vDG may be a key factor in determining individual levels of vulnerability to stress and related psychiatric disorders.},

We developed a dictionary with semantic synonyms and translations to different languages for mining EMR. The MS Ontology was integrated with other ontologies and dictionaries (diseases/comorbidities, gene/protein, pathways, drug) into the text-mining tool SCAIView. We analyzed the EMRs from 624 patients with MS using the MS ontology dictionary in order to identify drug usage and comorbidities in MS. Testing competency questions and functional evaluation using F statistics further validated the usefulness of MS ontology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Validation of the lexicalized ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed an adequate performance (F score = 0.73). The MS Ontology retrieved 80{\%} of the genes associated with MS from scientific abstracts and identified additional pathways targeted by approved disease-modifying drugs (e.g. apoptosis pathways associated with mitoxantrone, rituximab and fingolimod). The analysis of the EMR from patients with MS identified current usage of disease modifying drugs and symptomatic therapy as well as comorbidities, which are in agreement with recent reports.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The MS Ontology provides a semantic framework that is able to automatically extract information from both scientific literature and EMR from patients with MS, revealing new pathogenesis insights as well as new clinical information.},

abstract = {The hope of the rapid translation of 'genes to drugs' has foundered on the reality that disease biology is complex, and that drug development must be driven by insights into biological responses. Systems biology aims to describe and to understand the operation of complex biological systems and ultimately to develop predictive models of human disease. Although meaningful molecular level models of human cell and tissue function are a distant goal, systems biology efforts are already influencing drug discovery. Large-scale gene, protein and metabolite measurements ('omics') dramatically accelerate hypothesis generation and testing in disease models. Computer simulations integrating knowledge of organ and system-level responses help prioritize targets and design clinical trials. Automation of complex primary human cell-based assay systems designed to capture emergent properties can now integrate a broad range of disease-relevant human biology into the drug discovery process, informing target and compound validation, lead optimization, and clinical indication selection. These systems biology approaches promise to improve decision making in pharmaceutical development.},

abstract = {Targeted genome editing technologies have enabled a broad range of research and medical applications. The Cas9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The hypothesis that contemporary organisms are also randomly constructed molecular automata is examined by modeling the gene as a binary (on-off) device and studying the behavior of large, randomly constructed nets of these binary "genes". The results suggest that, if each "gene" is directly affected by two or three other "genes", then such random nets: behave with great order and stability; undergo behavior cycles whose length predicts cell replication time as a function of the number of genes per cell; possess different modes of behavior whose number per net predicts roughly the number of cell types in an organism as a function of its number of genes; and under the stimulus of noise are capable of differentiating directly from any mode of behavior to at most a few other modes of behavior. Cellular differentation is modeled as a Markov chain among the modes of behavior of a genetic net. The possibility of a general theory of metabolic behavior is suggested. {\textcopyright} 1969.},

abstract = {We describe a computational protocol for the ARACNE algorithm, an information-theoretic method for identifying transcriptional interactions between gene products using microarray expression profile data. Similar to other algorithms, ARACNE predicts potential functional associations among genes, or novel functions for uncharacterized genes, by identifying statistical dependencies between gene products. However, based on biochemical validation, literature searches and DNA binding site enrichment analysis, ARACNE has also proven effective in identifying bona fide transcriptional targets, even in complex mammalian networks. Thus we envision that predictions made by ARACNE, especially when supplemented with prior knowledge or additional data sources, can provide appropriate hypotheses for the further investigation of cellular networks. While the examples in this protocol use only gene expression profile data, the algorithm's theoretical basis readily extends to a variety of other high-throughput measurements, such as pathway-specific or genome-wide proteomics, microRNA and metabolomics data. As these data become readily available, we expect that ARACNE might prove increasingly useful in elucidating the underlying interaction models. For a microarray data set containing approximately 10,000 probes, reconstructing the network around a single probe completes in several minutes using a desktop computer with a Pentium 4 processor. Reconstructing a genome-wide network generally requires a computational cluster, especially if the recommended bootstrapping procedure is used.},

In addition to its involvement in regulating translation, p70S6K activation has been implicated in cell cycle control and neuronal cell differentiation. Recent data obtained in this laboratory suggests that p70S6K may also function in regulating cell motility, a cellular response that is important in tumour metastases, the immune response and tissue repair.

abstract = {Cytokines such as TNF and FASL can trigger death or survival depending on cell lines and cellular conditions. The mechanistic details of how a cell chooses among these cell fates are still unclear. The understanding of these processes is important since they are altered in many diseases, including cancer and AIDS. Using a discrete modelling formalism, we present a mathematical model of cell fate decision recapitulating and integrating the most consistent facts extracted from the literature. This model provides a generic high-level view of the interplays between NFkappaB pro-survival pathway, RIP1-dependent necrosis, and the apoptosis pathway in response to death receptor-mediated signals. Wild type simulations demonstrate robust segregation of cellular responses to receptor engagement. Model simulations recapitulate documented phenotypes of protein knockdowns and enable the prediction of the effects of novel knockdowns. In silico experiments simulate the outcomes following ligand removal at different stages, and suggest experimental approaches to further validate and specialise the model for particular cell types. We also propose a reduced conceptual model implementing the logic of the decision process. This analysis gives specific predictions regarding cross-talks between the three pathways, as well as the transient role of RIP1 protein in necrosis, and confirms the phenotypes of novel perturbations. Our wild type and mutant simulations provide novel insights to restore apoptosis in defective cells. The model analysis expands our understanding of how cell fate decision is made. Moreover, our current model can be used to assess contradictory or controversial data from the literature. Ultimately, it constitutes a valuable reasoning tool to delineate novel experiments.},

The functional cancer genome and proteome provide rich sources of information to identify patient-specific variations in signaling pathways and activities within and across tumors; however, current analytic methods lack the ability to exploit the diverse and multi-layered architecture of these complex biological networks. We assessed pan-cancer pathway activities for {\textgreater}7700 patients across 32 tumor types from The Cancer Proteome Atlas by developing a personalized cancer-specific integrated network estimation (PRECISE) model. PRECISE is a general Bayesian framework for integrating existing interaction databases, data-driven de novo causal structures, and upstream molecular profiling data to estimate cancer-specific integrated networks, infer patient-specific networks and elicit interpretable pathway-level signatures. PRECISE-based pathway signatures, can delineate pan-cancer commonalities and differences in proteomic network biology within and across tumors, demonstrates robust tumor stratification that is both biologically and clinically informative and superior prognostic power compared to existing approaches.

abstract = {We have analysed the influence of neighbouring base sequences on the mutagenesis induced by 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG or G(o)), a typical oxidative lesion of DNA, using the yeast oligonucleotide transformation technique. Two oligonucleotides, oligo-CCG(o) and oligo-CGG(o), each possessing a single 8-oxoG residue and represented by the sequences 5'-CCG(o)-3' and 5'-CGG(o)-3', respectively, were introduced into a chromosome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and their mutagenic potentials were compared. In a wild-type strain, 8-oxoG showed very weak mutagenic potential in both cases. However, the lesion in 5'-CCG(o)-3' can cause efficient G-to-T transversion in a strain lacking the rad30 gene which encodes yeast DNA polymerase eta (Ypoleta). To explore the properties associated with this translesion synthesis (TLS), the same two oligonucleotides possessing an 8-oxoG were used as templates for a standing-start primer extension assay, and the nucleotide incorporation opposite 8-oxoG was investigated. We found that dATP incorporation opposite 8-oxoG with Ypoleta was low for both sequences. In particular, very low dATP incorporation was observed for the 5'-CCG(o)-3' sequence. These results account for the efficient inhibition of mutagenesis by Ypoleta. TLS plays an important role in one DNA sequence in terms of avoiding mutagenesis induced by 8-oxoG in yeast. In contrast, human yeast DNA polymerase eta showed higher dATP incorporation rates even with the 5'-CCG(o)-3' sequence.},

However, dip coating CNTs is not very reproducible and the CNTs tend to lay flat on the electrode surface which limits access to the electroactive sites on the ends. In this study, aligned CNT forests were formed using a chemical self-assembly method, which resulted in more exposed CNT ends to the analyte. Shortened, carboxylic acid functionalized single-walled CNTs were assembled from a dimethylformamide (DMF) suspension onto a carbon-fiber disk microelectrode modified with a thin iron hydroxide-decorated Nafion film. The modified electrodes were highly sensitive, with 36-fold higher oxidation currents for dopamine using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry than bare electrodes and 34-fold more current than electrodes dipped in CNTs. The limit of detection (LOD) for dopamine was 17 ± 3 nMat a 10 Hz repetition rate and 65 ± 7 nM at 90 Hz. The LOD at 90 Hz was the same as a bare electrode at 10 Hz, allowing a 9-fold increase in temporal resolution without a decrease in sensitivity. Similar increases were observed for other cationic catecholamine neurotransmitters, and the increases in current were greater than for anionic interferents such as ascorbic acid and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). The CNT forest electrodes had high sensitivity at 90 Hz repetition rate when stimulated dopamine release was measured in Drosophila. The sensitivity, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution of these CNT forest modified disk electrodes facilitate enhanced electrochemical measurements of neurotransmitter release in vivo},

Here, we report characterization of Cpf1, a putative class 2 CRISPR effector. We demonstrate that Cpf1 mediates robust DNA interference with features distinct from Cas9. Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease lacking tracrRNA, and it utilizes a T-rich protospacer-adjacent motif. Moreover, Cpf1 cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA double-stranded break. Out of 16 Cpf1-family proteins, we identified two candidate enzymes from Acidaminococcus and Lachnospiraceae, with efficient genome-editing activity in human cells.

In light of the diversity of downstream effector targets known to facilitate Ras function, it is perhaps not surprising that Ras regulation of cell survival is complex, involving the balance and interplay of multiple signaling networks. While our understanding of these events is still far from complete, and is complicated by cell type and signaling context differences, several important mechanisms have begun to emerge. We review the role and mechanism of specific effectors in regulating the antiapoptotic (Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Tiam1) and apoptotic (Nore1 and RASSF1) actions of oncogenic Ras, and discuss the possibility that the effector actions of p120RasGAP make a significant contribution to Ras regulation of apoptotic events.},

In experiments with bilateral CPEs, one of which was combined with a dialysis probe, no difference was observed in either basal or stimulated ascorbate currents. Addition of different concentrations of ascorbate to the perfusion fluid produced rapid changes in the voltammetric current due to ascorbate oxidation. Irrespective of the concentration of ascorbate infused, the current returned to basal level when the perfusion was stopped. The return was found to be more rapid after infusion of concentrations of ascorbate higher than the extracellular concentration than after perfusion with ascorbate-free solutions. This demonstrates that homeostasis of ascorbate occurs in vivo. The calculated point of zero net flux was 416 ?? 66 ??M (n = 6). This represents the extracellular concentration of ascorbate.},

abstract = {Conflicting results concerning the ability of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor to associate with and/or activate phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 3-kinase have been published. Despite the ability of EGF to stimulate the production of PtdIns 3-kinase products and to cause the appearance of PtdIns 3-kinase activity in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates in several cell lines, we did not detect EGF-stimulated PtdIns 3-kinase activity in anti-EGF receptor immunoprecipitates. This result is consistent with the lack of a phosphorylated Tyr-X-X-Met motif, the p85 Src homology 2 (SH2) domain recognition sequence, in this receptor sequence. The EGF receptor homolog, ErbB2 protein, also lacks this motif. However, the ErbB3 protein has seven repeats of the Tyr-X-X-Met motif in the carboxy-terminal unique domain. Here we show that in A431 cells, which express both the EGF receptor and ErbB3, PtdIns 3-kinase coprecipitates with the ErbB3 protein (p180erbB3) in response to EGF. p180erbB3 is also shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EGF. In contrast, a different mechanism for the activation of PtdIns 3-kinase in response to EGF occurs in certain cells (PC12 and A549 cells). Thus, we show for the first time that ErbB3 can mediate EGF responses in cells expressing both ErbB3 and the EGF receptor.},

abstract = {Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a representative model of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), and offers a means of understanding their common principles and fundamental mechanisms. Furthermore, EGFR plays an essential role in cell proliferation and migration, and the disruption of EGFR signaling has been implicated in the development and growth of cancer. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a key mediator of EGFR function, and can be directly regulated by upstream binding partners in an EGF-dependent manner. PLD regulates downstream molecules by generating phosphatidic acid (PA), but it also dynamically interacts with a variety of intracellular molecules and these interactions spatiotemporally regulate EGFR function and serve as a hub that orchestrates signaling flow. This review summarizes the interrelationship between PLD and its binding molecules in the context of EGFR signaling, and addresses the roles of PLD in the mediation and coordination of this signaling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It has also greatly expanded into the translational sciences, with approaches pioneered in yeast now being applied to elucidate human development and disease. Here, we review the state of the field with a focus on four emerging applications of systems biology that are likely to be of particular importance during the decade to follow: (a) pathway-based biomarkers, (b) global genetic interaction maps, (c) systems approaches to identify disease genes, and (d) stem cell systems biology. We also cover recent advances in software tools that allow biologists to explore system-wide models and to formulate new hypotheses.

abstract = {The incidence of infections caused by Candida species (candidosis) has increased considerably over the past three decades, mainly due to the rise of the AIDS epidemic, an increasingly aged population, higher numbers of immunocompromised patients and the more widespread use of indwelling medical devices. Candida albicans is the main cause of candidosis; however, non-C. albicans Candida (NCAC) species such as Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Candida parapsilosis are now frequently identified as human pathogens. The apparent increased emergence of these species as human pathogens can be attributed to improved identification methods and also associated with the degree of diseases of the patients, the interventions that they were subjected and the drugs used. Candida pathogenicity is facilitated by a number of virulence factors, most importantly adherence to host surfaces including medical devices, biofilm formation and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. proteases, phospholipases and haemolysins). Furthermore, despite extensive research to identify pathogenic factors in fungi, particularly in C. albicans, relatively little is known about NCAC species. This review provides information on the current state of knowledge on the biology, identification, epidemiology, pathogenicity and antifungal resistance of C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis.},

abstract = {The production of new types of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the use of products containing or derived from these materials are expanding globally. This poses a challenge in providing cost-effective comprehensive analyses. In this line, the state of art testing approaches rely on a matrix representing the GM events with their corresponding GM markers - DNA elements used in plants' transformation. Accordingly, this study aimed first at constructing an updated and comprehensive matrix of genetic characterization of GM events based on an extensive review of the relevant databases. Inclusive lists of 356 GM markers and 508 events in 29 plant species were compiled and organized into a matrix. The frequency of occurrence of these elements was then determined. Moreover, for the first time, a matrix representing the regulatory status of every compiled GM event was established. Remarkably, numerous inconsistencies were detected among the databases at the levels of nomenclature, events' registry, molecular characterization and regulatory approvals. Both matrices represent a useful tool for comprehensive and cost-effective analyses. The genetic matrix permits designing the most straightforward testing strategy that provides the maximum information about GMOs in a sample in the minimum number of experimental steps. Moreover, the novel regulatory matrix, allows further decreasing the number of required event-specific identification tests by giving higher probabilities to those authorized in the samples' country of origin. Finally, the genetics and regulatory matrices represent the building-block for establishing an inclusive automated database for GMOs which is instrumental for testing laboratories worldwide.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014. Genetic interactions occur when mutant alleles of two or more genes collaborate to generate an unusual composite phenotype, one that would not be predicted based on the expected combined effects of the individual mutant alleles. Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) methodology was developed to automate yeast genetic analysis and enable systematic genetic interaction studies. In its simplest form, SGA consists of a series of replica pinning steps, which enable the construction of haploid double mutants through mating and meiotic recombination. For example, a strain carrying a query mutation, such as a deletion allele of a nonessential gene or a conditional temperature sensitive allele of an essential gene, could be crossed to an input array of yeast mutants, such as the complete set of ∼5,000 viable deletion mutants, to generate an output array of double mutants, that can be scored for genetic interactions based on estimates of cellular fitness derived from colony-size measurements. A simple quantitative measure of genetic interactions can be derived from colony size, which serves as a proxy for fitness. Furthermore, SGA can be applied in a variety of other contexts, such as Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL), in which a query mutation is crossed into an array of yeast strains, each of which overexpresses a different gene, thus making use of SGA to probe for gain-of-function phenotypes in specific genetic backgrounds. High-Content Screening (HCS) also integrates SGA to perform genome-wide screens for quantitative analysis of morphological phenotypes or pathway activity based upon fluorescent markers, extending genetic interaction analysis beyond fitness-based measurements. Genetic interaction studies offer insight into gene function, pathway structure, and buffering, and thus a complete genetic interaction network of yeast will generate a global functional wiring diagram for a eukaryotic cell.},

The expression of this pathway is frequently altered in breast and other cancers due to mutations at or aberrant expression of: HER2, EGFR1, PIK3CA, and PTEN as well as other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. miRs and epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation are also important events which regulate this pathway. In some breast cancer cases, mutations at certain components of this pathway (e.g., PIK3CA) are associated with a better prognosis than breast cancers lacking these mutations. The expression of this pathway has been associated with CICs and in some cases resistance to therapeutics. We will review the effects of activation of the EGFR/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC pathway primarily in breast cancer and development of drug resistance. The targeting of this pathway and other interacting pathways will be discussed as well as clinical trials with novel small molecule inhibitors as well as established drugs that are used to treat other diseases.

In both cases the enzymes were immobilized on an oxygen selective Clark electrode. The simultaneous determination of the two organic acids can be accomplished either in batch or in a flow injection analysis apparatus using the same biosensors as detectors.

Advancements were achieved through introduction of transmissive scanning hardware and software technology, frequent acquisition of exact colony population size measurements, extraction of population growth rates from growth curves and removal of spatial bias by reference-surface normalization. Our prototype arrangement automatically records and analyzes close to 100,000 growth curves in parallel.

Implementation of an intervention policy derived for probabilistic Boolean networks requires nearly continuous observation of the underlying biological system since precise application requires the observation of all transitions.

The human protein Grb2 binds to ligand-activated growth factor receptors and downstream effector proteins through its Src-homology (SH) domains SH2 and SH3, respectively, and like its homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans, Sem-5, apparently forms part of a highly conserved pathway by which these receptors can control Ras activity. Here we show that the SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to the carboxy-terminal part of hSos1, the human homologue of the Drosophila guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor for Ras, which is essential for control of Ras activity by epidermal growth factor receptor and sevenless. Moreover, a synthetic 10-amino-acid peptide containing the sequence PPVPPR specifically blocks the interaction. These results indicate that the Grb2/hSos1 complex couples activated EGF receptor to Ras signalling.},

We also integrate and apply a number of systematic algorithms like cross correlation threshold, maximum likelihood estimation method and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) on time-lapsed microarray data to refine the genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network in response to bacterial endotoxins in the context of dynamic activated genes, which are regulated by transcription factors (TFs) such as NF-kappaB. This systematic approach is used to investigate the stochastic interaction represented by the dynamic leukocyte gene expression profiles of human subject exposed to an inflammatory stimulus (bacterial endotoxin). Based on the kinetic parameters of the dynamic gene regulatory network, we identify important properties (such as susceptibility to infection) of the immune system, which may be useful for translational research. Finally, robustness of the inflammatory gene network is also inferred by analyzing the hubs and "weak ties" structures of the gene network.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In this study, Data mining and dynamic network analyses were integrated to examine the gene regulatory network in the inflammatory response system. Compared with previous methodologies reported in the literatures, the proposed gene network perturbation method has shown a great improvement in analyzing the systemic inflammation.},

abstract = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids by using CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to guide the silencing of invading nucleic acids. We show here that in a subset of these systems, the mature crRNA that is base-paired to trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) forms a two-RNA structure that directs the CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 to introduce double-stranded (ds) breaks in target DNA. At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

The widely targeted method consists of 2 analyses, namely, gas chromatography-quadrupole-mass spectrometry (GC-Q-MS) operated in selected ion monitoring mode with 25m/z channels, and liquid chromatography triple-stage quadrupole (LC-QqQ)-MS operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. This platform was set up to identify and quantify preselected 99 compounds, including sugars, sugar phosphates, organic acids, amino acids, and cofactors. The method showed good sensitivity and a wide dynamic range. For example, limits of detection for lactate and l-phenylalanine were 1.4fmol and 2.0fmol, respectively. The dynamic ranges for GC-Q-MS analysis and LC-QqQ-MS analysis were approximately 102-105 and 103-104, respectively. The metabolite profiles of 2 yeast strains, YPH499 and BY4741, under glucose-fermenting conditions were compared using the developed method. Although YPH499 and BY4741 were derived from an identical experimental strain, the profiling analysis successfully revealed a variation in metabolic phenotypes among experimental yeast strains demonstrating that the widely targeted method could be a robust and useful method for the investigation of metabolic phenotypes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ?? 2012 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is an established community XML format for the markup of biochemical models. With the introduction of SBML level 2 version 3, specific model entities, such as species or reactions, can now be annotated using ontological terms. These annotations, which are encoded using the resource description framework (RDF), provide the facility to specify definite terms to individual components, allowing software to unambiguously identify such components and thus link the models to existing data resources. libSBML is an application programming interface library for the manipulation of SBML files. While libSBML provides the facilities for reading and writing such annotations from and to models, it is beyond the scope of libSBML to provide interpretation of these terms. The libAnnotationSBML library introduced here acts as a layer on top of libSBML linking SBML annotations to the web services that describe these ontological terms. Two applications that use this library are described: SbmlSynonymExtractor finds name synonyms of SBML model entities and SbmlReactionBalancer checks SBML files to determine whether specifed reactions are elementally balanced.},

abstract = {Within the frame of the EU-funded MARLON project, background data were reviewed to explore the possibility of measuring health indicators during post-market monitoring for potential effects of feeds, particularly genetically modified (GM) feeds, on livestock animal health, if applicable. Four case studies (CSs) of potential health effects on livestock were framed and the current knowledge of a possible effect of GM feed was reviewed. Concerning allergenicity (CS-1), there are no case-reports of allergic reactions or immunotoxic effects resulting from GM feed consumption as compared with non-GM feed. The likelihood of horizontal gene transfer (HGT; CS-2) of GMO-related DNA to different species is not different from that for other DNA and is unlikely to raise health concerns. Concerning mycotoxins (CS-3), insect-resistant GM maize may reduce fumonisins contamination as a health benefit, yet other Fusarium toxins and aflatoxins show inconclusive results. For nutritionally altered crops (CS-4), the genetic modifications applied lead to compositional changes which require special considerations of their nutritional impacts. No health indicators were thus identified except for possible beneficial impacts of reduced mycotoxins and nutritional enhancement. More generally, veterinary health data should ideally be linked with animal exposure information so as to be able to establish cause-effect relationships.},

abstract = {The ErbB signaling network consists of four transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases and more than a dozen ligands sharing an epidermal growth factor (EGF) motif. The multiplicity of ErbB-specific ligands is incompletely understood in terms of signal specificity because all ErbB molecules signal through partially overlapping pathways. Here we addressed the action of epiregulin, a recently isolated ligand of ErbB-1. By employing a set of factor-dependent cell lines engineered to express individual ErbBs or their combinations, we found that epiregulin is the broadest specificity EGF-like ligand so far characterized: not only does it stimulate homodimers of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-4, it also activates all possible heterodimeric ErbB complexes. Consistent with its relaxed selectivity, epiregulin binds the various receptor combinations with an affinity that is approximately 100-fold lower than the affinity of ligands with more stringent selectivity, including EGF. Nevertheless, epiregulin's action upon most receptor combinations transmits a more potent mitogenic signal than does EGF. This remarkable discrepancy between binding affinity and bioactivity is permitted by a mechanism that prevents receptor down-regulation, and results in a weak, but prolonged, state of receptor activation.},

abstract = {Synthetic Biology offers qualitatively new perspectives on the benefits of industrially harnessed biological processes. The ability to modify and reprogramme natural biology increases the scope of tailored bioprocesses and yields attractive prospects beyond conventional Biotechnology. The present review summarises the major achievements and categorises them according to a hierarchy of system levels. Similar structures are known in the engineering sciences and might prove useful for the future development of Synthetic Biology. The hierarchy encompasses several levels of detail. Biological (macro-)molecules present the most detailed level (parts), followed by compartmentalised or non-compartmentalised modules (devices). In the next level, parts and devices are combined into functional cells and further into cellular communities. The manifold interactions between biological entities of the same hierarchical level or between different levels are accounted for by networks, primarily metabolic pathways and regulatory circuits. Networks of different types are represented as a superordinate hierarchical level that achieves full system integration. On all these levels, extensive and sound scientific foundations exist regarding experimental but also theoretical methods. These have led to diverse manifestations of Synthetic Biology on the parts and devices levels. Investigations involving synthetic components on the systems scale represent the most difficult and remain limited in number. A main challenge lies with the quantitative prediction of interactions between different entities across different scales. Systems-theoretical approaches provide important tools to analyse complex biological behaviour and can support the design of artificial biological systems. A promising strategy is seen in an efficient modularisation that reduces biological systems to a limited set of functional modules with well-characterised interfaces. For the design of synthetic biological systems the interactions across these interfaces should be standardised to reduce complexity. Yet, the identification of modules and standardised interaction routes remains a non-trivial problem. Furthermore, an appropriate platform that efficiently describes replication and evolutionary processes has to be developed in order to extend the achievements of Synthetic Biology into designed biological processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Successful discovery efforts have integrated multiple disciplines and make use of all the modern tools of target-based discovery - structure, computation, screening, and biomarkers.

The gap genes are expressed in defined domains along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo, as a response to asymmetric maternal information in the oocyte. Though many of the individual interactions among maternal and gap genes are reasonably well understood, we still lack a thorough understanding of the dynamic behavior of the system as a whole. Based on a generalized logical formalization, the present analysis leads to the delineation of: (1) the minimal number of distinct, qualitative, functional levels associated with each of the key regulatory factors (the three maternal Bcd, Hb and Cad products, and the four gap Gt, Hb, Kr and Kni products); (2) the most crucial interactions and regulatory circuits of the earliest stages of the segmentation process; (3) the ordering of different regulatory interactions governed by each of these products according to corresponding concentration scales; and (4) the role of gap-gene cross-interactions in the transformation of graded maternal information into discrete gap-gene expression domains. The proposed model allows not only the qualitative reproduction of the patterns of gene expression characterized experimentally, but also the simulation and prediction of single and multiple mutant phenotypes.},

Phenotype ontologies were developed to capture and compare phenotypes within the context of a single species.

We have developed a method to transform phenotype ontologies into a formal representation, combine phenotype ontologies with anatomy ontologies, and apply a measure of semantic similarity to construct the PhenomeNET cross-species phenotype network. We demonstrate that PhenomeNET can identify orthologous genes, genes involved in the same pathway and gene-disease associations through the comparison of mutant phenotypes. We provide evidence that the Adam19 and Fgf15 genes in mice are involved in the tetralogy of Fallot, and, using zebrafish phenotypes, propose the hypothesis that the mammalian homologs of Cx36.7 and Nkx2.5 lie in a pathway controlling cardiac morphogenesis and electrical conductivity which, when defective, cause the tetralogy of Fallot phenotype. Our method implements a whole-phenome approach toward disease gene discovery and can be applied to prioritize genes for rare and orphan diseases for which the molecular basis is unknown.},

These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling approaches, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. In silico methods are primarily used alongside the generation of in vitro data both to create the model and to test it. Such models have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The aim of this review is to illustrate some of the in silico methods for pharmacology that are used in drug discovery.

abstract = {Akt is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions such as cell proliferation, energy metabolism, and apoptosis. Although three Akt isoforms are known, the function of each isoform is poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of each Akt isoform, we examined the subcellular localization and expression of each isoform in transformed and nontransformed cells. Akt1 was localized in the cytoplasm, which is in agreement with the currently accepted model that cytoplasmic Akt is translocated and activated at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Interestingly, HEK-293 and HEK-293T cells contained Akt1 in the nucleus and cytoplasm, respectively, suggesting that SV40 T-antigen plays a crucial role in the cytoplasmic localization and activation of Akt1 in HEK-293T. Akt2 was colocalized with the mitochondria, while Akt3 was localized in both the nucleus and nuclear membrane. The subcellular localization of the Akt isoforms was not substantially altered in response to ionizing radiation or EGF. Furthermore, the ablation of one Akt isoform by small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not alter the subcellular location of the remaining isoforms, suggesting that the major function of one isoform is not compensated for by other isoforms. Together, our data support the notion that Akt2 and Akt3 are regulated at the mitochondrial and nuclear membranes, respectively. The mitochondrial localization of Akt2 raises the possibility that this isoform may be involved in both glucose-based energy metabolism and suppression of apoptosis, two Akt functions previously identified with anti-pan-Akt antibodies.},

abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activates several signaling cascades in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. One of these signaling events involves tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), whereas another involves activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase pathway. Two possibilities for STAT activation exist: a janus kinase (JAK)-dependent and a JAK-independent mechanism. Herein, we demonstrate that EGFR overexpression in primary esophageal keratinocytes activates STAT in a JAK-dependent fashion with the functional consequence of enhanced cell migration, which can be abolished by use of a JAK-specific inhibitor, AG-490. We determined the mechanisms underlying the signal transduction pathway responsible for increased cell migration. Stimulation of EGFR induces Tyr701 phosphorylation of STAT1 and initiates complex formation of STAT1 and STAT3 with JAK1 and JAK2. Thereafter, the STATs translocate to the nucleus within 15 min. In addition, we found that activation of this signaling pathway results in matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity. By contrast, Akt activation does not impact the EGFR-STATs-JAKs complex formation and nuclear translocation of the STATs with subsequent MMP-1 activity, although Akt activation may contribute to cell migration through an independent mechanism. Taken together, we find that the recruitment of the STAT-JAK complex by EGFR is responsible for keratinocyte migration that, in turn, might be mediated by MMP-1 activation.},

abstract = {A novel and robust automated docking method that predicts the bound conformations of flexible ligands to macromolecular targets has been developed and tested, in combination with a new scoring function that estimates the free energy change upon binding. Interestingly, this method applies a Lamarckian model of genetics, in which environmental adaptations of an individual's phenotype are reverse transcribed into its genotype and become {\v{Z}} . heritable traits sic . We consider three search methods, Monte Carlo simulated annealing, a traditional genetic algorithm, and the Lamarckian genetic algorithm, and compare their performance in dockings of seven protein᎐ligand test systems having known three-dimensional structure. We show that both the traditional and Lamarckian genetic algorithms can handle ligands with more degrees of freedom than the simulated annealing method used in earlier versions of AUTODOCK, and that the Lamarckian genetic algorithm is the most efficient, reliable, and successful of the three. The empirical free energy function was calibrated using a set of 30 structurally known protein᎐ligand complexes with experimentally determined binding constants. Linear regression analysis of the observed binding constants in terms of a wide variety of structure-derived molecular properties was performed. The final model had a residual standard y1 {\v{Z}} y1 . error of 9.11 kJ mol 2.177 kcal mol and was chosen as the new energy},

Quantitative, tag-based studies of gene expression were one of the earliest applications of these next-generation technologies, but the tremendous depth of sequencing facilitates de novo transcript discovery, which replaces traditional expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing. In addition, these technologies have created new opportunities for understanding the generation, stability, and decay of RNA and the impacts of chromatin differences on gene expression. As we review the impact of these methods on plant biology, we also mention published studies from animal systems when the methods are broadly applicable. We can anticipate that the published work over the past few years is a harbinger of much broader studies that are yet to be published and are sure to further advance our understanding of plant genomes in a field changing at a dizzying pace.},

abstract = {Although epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity in a number of types of cells or cell lines, in most cases that we have investigated the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase does not appear to bind directly to the EGF receptor. Previously we demonstrated that EGF-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase activity in A431 cells is accompanied by the binding of p85 to ErbB3, an EGF receptor homologue. However, this mechanism did not explain the large activation of PI 3-kinase activity that was found in PC12 and A549 cells, which possess little or no ErbB3. Here we provide evidence that the p120cbl proto-oncoprotein is an intracellular adapter protein that associates with PI 3-kinase and thus is involved in the EGF-dependent activation of this enzyme in these two cell lines. Using an anti-p120cbl antibody, we immunoprecipitated the EGF receptor from PC12 cells and PI 3-kinase activity from PC12 and A549 cells in an EGF-dependent fashion. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor or insulin stimulated large increases in PI 3-kinase activity that was immunoprecipitated using anti-Tyr(P) antibody but not using anti-p120cbl antibody. In EGF-treated PC12 cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p120cbl displayed similar kinetics to the activation of PI 3-kinase as measured by both in vivo lipid production and lipid kinase assays conducted using anti-p120cbl and anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates. The use of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of various domains of p85 demonstrated that p120cbl associated with both the SH2 and SH3 domains of p85. p120cbl was also present in A431 cells and offers an additional pathway by which EGF can activate PI 3-kinase in these cells.},

The method provides accurate, stimulus-specific measurement of phosphoproteome changes, quantitative analysis of phosphodynamics at sub-minute temporal resolution, and detection of more phosphosites. Rates of evolution of dynamic phosphosites were comparable to those of known functional phosphosites and significantly lower than static or longer-time-frame dynamic phosphosites. Kinetic profile analyses indicated that putatively functional kinase- or phosphatase-substrate interactions occur more rapidly, within 60 s, than promiscuous interactions. Finally, we report many changes in phosphorylation of proteins implicated in cytoskeletal and mitotic spindle dynamics that may underlie regulation of cell cycle and morphogenesis.},

They represent the most widely distributed family of repeats among prokaryotic genomes suggesting a biological function. The origin of the intervening sequences, at present unknown, could provide clues about their biological activities. Here we show that CRISPR spacers derive from preexisting sequences, either chromosomal or within transmissible genetic elements such as bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids. Remarkably, these extrachromosomal elements fail to infect the specific spacer-carrier strain, implying a relationship between CRISPR and immunity against targeted DNA. Bacteriophages and conjugative plasmids are involved in prokaryotic population control, evolution, and pathogenicity. All these biological traits could be influenced by the presence of specific spacers. CRISPR loci can be visualized as mosaics of a repeated unit, separated by sequences at some time present elsewhere in the cell.},

abstract = {STAT proteins are a group of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors which function as signal transducers and activators of transcription. Stat1 and -2 were originally identified to function in interferon signaling, and Stat1 was also found to be activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other cytokines. New members of the STAT gene family are identified. Among them, Stat3 has 52.5{\%} amino acid sequence homology with Stat1 and is activated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), EGF, interleukin-6, and other cytokines. Treatment of cells with EGF activates Stat1 and Stat3, which become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues to form homo - or heterodimers and translocate into the nucleus, binding to the sis-inducible element (SIE) in the c-fos promoter. Somatic cell genetic analyses demonstrated that Jaks, a family of nontransmembrane protein tyrosine kinases, are required for the activation of Stat1 and Stat2 in interferon-treated cells. However, little is known about the activation of Stat3 by growth factors. Here we report that in all v-Src-transformed cell lines examined, Stat3 is constitutively activated to bind to DNA and the phosphorylation of tyrosine on Stat3 is enhanced by the induction of v-Src expression. We also report that Src is shown to be associated with Stat3 in vivo, as well as in vitro, and phosphorylates Stat3 in vitro. Stat3 is also activated by CSF-1, possibly through CSF-1 receptor-c Src association in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing CSF-1 receptors. Together, the data suggest that Src is involved in activation of Stat3 in growth factor signal transduction.},

In this approach, the energetic distribution of the charge carriers in a Gaussian shaped density of states (DOS) is calculated under thermal equilibrium conditions and compared to the energetic distribution of the current. The description is based on the Miller–Abraham model for hopping in a disordered material and utilizes the so-called transport energy concept. To include also the case of higher electron concentrations in the tail states of the DOS the Fermi distribution was taken into account. Furthermore, additional trap states in the gap are considered to describe the experimental data at low doping concentration more correctly. In the framework of the model there is no indication of a thermally activated ionization of the dopants. In contrast to other descriptions, the position of the Fermi energy and transport energy are calculated from the model. It is demonstrated that the principal behavior of the transport parameter can be well explained in terms of classical semiconductor physics.},

RESULTS We describe the implementation of DataRail, an open source MATLAB-based toolbox that stores experimental data in flexible multi-dimensional arrays, transforms arrays so as to maximize information content, and then constructs models using internal or external tools. Data integrity is maintained via a containment hierarchy for arrays, imposition of a metadata standard based on a newly proposed MIDAS format, assignment of semantically typed universal identifiers, and implementation of a procedure for storing the history of all transformations with the array.

abstract = {The generation of second messengers from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by phosphoinositidase C has been implicated in the mediation of cellular responses to a variety of growth factors and oncogene products. The first step in the production of PtdInsP2 from phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) is catalysed by PtdIns kinase. A PtdIns kinase activity has been found to associate specifically with several oncogene products, as well as with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. We have previously identified two biochemically distinct PtdIns kinases in fibroblasts, and have found that only one of these, designated type I, specifically associates with activated tyrosine kinases. We have now characterized the site on the inositol ring phosphorylated by type I PtdIns kinase, and find that this kinase specifically phosphorylates the D-3 ring position to generate a novel phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P). In contrast, the main PtdIns kinase in fibroblasts, designated type II, specifically phosphorylates the D-4 position to produce phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), previously considered to be the only form of PtdInsP. We have also tentatively identified PtdIns(3)P as a minor component of total PtdInsP in intact fibroblasts. We propose that type I PtdIns kinase is responsible for the generation of PtdIns(3)P in intact cells, and that this novel phosphoinositide could be important in the transduction of mitogenic and oncogenic signals.},

Cyanovirin-N is an elongated, largely beta-sheet protein that displays internal two-fold pseudosymmetry. The two sequence repeats (residues 1-50 and 51-101) share 32{\%} sequence identity and superimpose with a backbone atomic root-mean-square difference of 1.3 A. The two repeats, however, do not form separate domains since the overall fold is dependent on numerous contacts between them. Rather, two symmetrically related domains are formed by strand exchange between the two repeats. Analysis of surface hydrophobic clusters suggests the location of potential binding sites for protein-protein interactions.},

To distinguish between "loss of function" and "gain of function" models of HD, the murine HD homolog Hdh was inactivated by gene targeting. Mice heterozygous for Hdh inactivation were phenotypically normal, whereas homozygosity resulted in embryonic death. Homozygotes displayed abnormal gastrulation at embryonic day 7.5 and were resorbing by day 8.5. Thus, huntingtin is critical early in embryonic development, before the emergence of the nervous system. That Hdh inactivation does not mimic adult HD neuropathology suggests that the human disease involves a gain of function.},

abstract = {Large-scale protein signalling networks are useful for exploring complex biochemical pathways but do not reveal how pathways respond to specific stimuli. Such specificity is critical for understanding disease and designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logical models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 82 proteins covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically increased predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number of interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear to be functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of model to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. Our approach, therefore, represents a means to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor p53 is commonly inhibited under conditions in which the phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase/protein kinase B (PKB)Akt pathway is activated. Intracellular levels of p53 are controlled by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. Here we show that PKB inhibits Mdm2 self-ubiquitination via phosphorylation of Mdm2 on Ser(166) and Ser(188). Stimulation of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with insulin-like growth factor-1 increased Mdm2 phosphorylation on Ser(166) and Ser(188) in a phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase-dependent manner, and the treatment of both human embryonic kidney 293 and COS-1 cells with phosphatidylinositide 3'-OH kinase inhibitor LY-294002 led to proteasome-mediated Mdm2 degradation. Introduction of a constitutively active form of PKB together with Mdm2 into cells induced phosphorylation of Mdm2 at Ser(166) and Ser(188) and stabilized Mdm2 protein. Moreover, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking PKBalpha displayed reduced Mdm2 protein levels with a concomitant increase of p53 and p21(Cip1), resulting in strongly elevated apoptosis after UV irradiation. In addition, activation of PKB correlated with Mdm2 phosphorylation and stability in a variety of human tumor cells. These findings suggest that PKB plays a critical role in controlling of the Mdm2.p53 signaling pathway by regulating Mdm2 stability.},

abstract = {Base-pairing of U4 and U6 snRNAs during di-snRNP assembly requires large-scale remodeling of RNA structure that is chaperoned by the U6 snRNP protein Prp24. We investigated the mechanism of U4/U6 annealing in vitro using an assay that enables visualization of ribonucleoprotein complexes and faithfully recapitulates known in vivo determinants for the process. We find that annealing, but not U6 RNA binding, is highly dependent on the electropositive character of a 20 A-wide groove on the surface of Prp24. During annealing, we observe the formation of a stable ternary complex between U4 and U6 RNAs and Prp24, indicating that displacement of Prp24 in vivo requires additional factors. Mutations that stabilize the U6 'telestem' helix increase annealing rates by up to 15-fold, suggesting that telestem formation is rate-limiting for U4/U6 pairing. The Lsm2-8 complex, which binds adjacent to the telestem at the 3' end of U6, provides a comparable rate enhancement. Collectively, these data identify domains of the U6 snRNP that are critical for one of the first steps in assembly of the megaDalton U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex, and lead to a dynamic model for U4/U6 pairing that involves a striking degree of evolved cooperativity between protein and RNA.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the generalized logical framework defined by Ren{\'{e}} Thomas in the 70's to qualitatively represent the dynamics of regulatory networks. In this formalism, a regulatory network is represented as a graph, where nodes denote regulatory components (basically genes) and edges denote regulations between these components. Discrete variables are associated to regulatory components accounting for their levels of expression. In most cases, Boolean variables are enough, but some situations may require further values. Despite this fact, the majority of tools dedicated to the analysis of logical models are restricted to the Boolean case. A formal Boolean mapping of multivalued logical models is a natural way of extending the applicability of these tools.Three decades ago, a multivalued to Boolean variable mapping was proposed by P. Van Ham. Since then, all works related to multivalued logical models and using a Boolean representation rely on this particular mapping. We formally show in this paper that this mapping is actually the sole, up to cosmetic changes, that could preserve the regulatory structures of the underlying graphs as well as their dynamical behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {What gives an organism the ability to regrow tissues and to recover function where another organism fails is the central problem of regenerative biology. The challenge is to describe the mechanisms of regeneration at the molecular level, delivering detailed insights into the many components that are cross-regulated. In other words, a broad, yet deep dissection of the system-wide network of molecular interactions is needed. Functional genomics has been used to elucidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in developing tissues, which, like regeneration, are complex systems. Therefore, we reason that the GRN approach, aided by next generation technologies, can also be applied to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex functions of regeneration. We ask what characteristics a model system must have to support a GRN analysis. Our discussion focuses on regeneration in the central nervous system, where loss of function has particularly devastating consequences for an organism. We examine a cohort of cells conserved across all vertebrates, the reticulospinal (RS) neurons, which lend themselves well to experimental manipulations. In the lamprey, a jawless vertebrate, there are giant RS neurons whose large size and ability to regenerate make them particularly suited for a GRN analysis. Adding to their value, a distinct subset of lamprey RS neurons reproducibly fail to regenerate, presenting an opportunity for side-by-side comparison of gene networks that promote or inhibit regeneration. Thus, determining the GRN for regeneration in RS neurons will provide a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental cues that lead to success or failure to regenerate.},

This widespread adoption has been largely fueled by the emergence of the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) technology, an important new approach for generating RNA-guided nucleases, such as Cas9, with customizable specificities. Genome editing mediated by these nucleases has been used to rapidly, easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a wide variety of biomedically important cell types and in organisms that have traditionally been challenging to manipulate genetically. Furthermore, a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been developed to recruit heterologous domains that can regulate endogenous gene expression or label specific genomic loci in living cells. Although the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 systems remain to be fully defined, the power of these systems to perform targeted, highly efficient alterations of genome sequence and gene expression will undoubtedly transform biological research and spur the development of novel molecular therapeutics for human disease.},

More precise genome editing, either the insertion or deletion of a desired fragment, can be done by combining the homology-directed-repair (HDR) pathway with CRISPR cleavage. However, HDR-mediated gene knock-in experiments are typically inefficient, and there have been no reports of successful gene knock-in with DNA fragments larger than 4 kb. Here, we describe the targeted insertion of large DNA fragments (7.4 and 5.8 kb) into the genomes of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and zygotes, respectively, using the CRISPR/HDR technique without NHEJ inhibitors. Our data show that CRISPR/HDR without NHEJ inhibitors can result in highly efficient gene knock-in, equivalent to CRISPR/HDR with NHEJ inhibitors. Although NHEJ is the dominant repair pathway associated with CRISPR-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs), and biallelic gene knock-ins are common, NHEJ and biallelic gene knock-ins were not detected. Our results demonstrate that efficient targeted insertion of large DNA fragments without NHEJ inhibitors is possible, a result that should stimulate interest in understanding the mechanisms of high efficiency CRISPR targeting in general.},

From this perspective, uncovering specific patterns of variation by comparing network structure among tissues could provide insights into systems-level mechanisms underlying cell behavior. Following this idea, here we propose an empirical framework to analyze mammalian tissue-specific networks, focusing on characterizing and contrasting their structure and behavior in response to perturbations. We structurally represent the state of the cell/tissue by condition specific transcription factor networks generated using chromatin accessibility data, and we profile their systems behavior in terms of the structural robustness against random and directed perturbations. Using this framework, we unveil the structural heterogeneity existing among tissues at different levels of differentiation. We uncover a novel and conserved systems property of regulatory networks underlying embryonic stem cells (ESCs): in contrast to terminally differentiated tissues, the promiscuous regulatory connectivity of ESCs produces a globally homogeneous network resulting in increased structural robustness. Possible biological consequences of this property are discussed.},

Similar to RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in eukaryotes, CRISPR-mediated immune systems rely on small RNAs for sequence-specific detection and silencing of foreign nucleic acids, including viruses and plasmids. However, the mechanism of RNA-based bacterial immunity is distinct from RNAi. Understanding how small RNAs are used to find and destroy foreign nucleic acids will provide new insights into the diverse mechanisms of RNA-controlled genetic silencing systems.},

abstract = {The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates a variety of cellular processes by activating specific transcriptional and translational programs. Ras/MAPK signaling promotes mRNA translation and protein synthesis, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence suggests that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an essential role in this process. Here, we show that Raptor, an essential scaffolding protein of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), becomes phosphorylated on proline-directed sites following activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. We found that ERK1 and ERK2 interact with Raptor in cells and mediate its phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Using mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found three proline-directed residues within Raptor, Ser8, Ser696, and Ser863, which are directly phosphorylated by ERK1/2. Expression of phosphorylation-deficient alleles of Raptor revealed that phosphorylation of these sites by ERK1/2 normally promotes mTORC1 activity and signaling to downstream substrates, such as 4E-BP1. Our data provide a novel regulatory mechanism by which mitogenic and oncogenic activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway promotes mTOR signaling.},

Yet, the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions, systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide 'omics' studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components. Here, we outline the challenges faced by systems biology and discuss limitations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches, which, despite these limitations, have already led to the discovery of mechanisms and principles that underlie cell function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A carbon paste electrode (CPE) held at constant potential was combined with a microdialysis probe through which various concentrations of ascorbate were locally infused. In experiments with bilateral CPEs, one of which was combined with a dialysis probe, no difference was observed in either basal or stimulated ascorbate currents. Addition of different concentrations of ascorbate to the perfusion fluid produced rapid changes in the voltammetric current due to ascorbate oxidation. Irrespective of the concentration of ascorbate infused, the current returned to basal level when the perfusion was stopped. The return was found to be more rapid after infusion of concentrations of ascorbate higher than the extracellular concentration than after perfusion with ascorbate-free solutions. This demonstrates that homeostasis of ascorbate occurs in vivo. The calculated point of zero net flux was 416 ?? 66 ??M (n = 6). This represents the extracellular concentration of ascorbate.},

abstract = {Initiation factor eIF4E binds to the 5'-cap of eukaryotic mRNAs and plays a key role in the mechanism and regulation of translation. It may be regulated through its own phosphorylation and through inhibitory binding proteins (4E-BPs), which modulate its availability for initiation complex assembly. eIF4E phosphorylation is enhanced by phorbol esters. We show, using specific inhibitors, that this involves both the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and Erk signaling pathways. Cell stresses such as arsenite and anisomycin and the cytokines tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] and interleukin-1[beta] also cause increased phosphorylation of eIF4E, which is abolished by the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. These changes in eIF4E phosphorylation parallel the activity of the eIF4E kinase, Mnk1. However other stresses such as heat shock, sorbitol, and H2O2, which also stimulate p38 MAP kinase and increase Mnk1 activity, do not increase phosphorylation of eIF4E. The latter stresses increase the binding of eIF4E to 4E-BP1, and we show that this blocks the phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1 in vitro, which may explain the absence of an increase in eIF4E phosphorylation under these conditions.},

abstract = {Background: The interplay between metabolic processes and signalling pathways remains poorly understood. Global, detailed and comprehensive reconstructions of human metabolism and signalling pathways exist in the form of molecular maps, but they have never been integrated together. We aim at filling in this gap by creating an integrated resource of both signalling and metabolic pathways allowing a visual exploration of multi-level omics data and study of cross-regulatory circuits between these processes in health and in disease. Results: We combined two comprehensive manually curated network maps. Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), containing mechanisms frequently implicated in cancer; and ReconMap 2.0, a comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolic network. We linked ACSN and ReconMap 2.0 maps via common players and represented the two maps as interconnected layers using the NaviCell platform for maps exploration. In addition, proteins catalysing metabolic reactions in ReconMap 2.0 were not previously visually represented on the map canvas. This precluded visualisation of omics data in the context of ReconMap 2.0. We suggested a solution for displaying protein nodes on the ReconMap 2.0 map in the vicinity of the corresponding reaction or process nodes. This permits multi-omics data visualisation in the context of both map layers. Exploration and shuttling between the two map layers is possible using Google Maps-like features of NaviCell. The integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 resource is accessible online and allows data visualisation through various modes such as markers, heat maps, bar-plots, glyphs and map staining. The integrated resource was applied for comparison of immunoreactive and proliferative ovarian cancer subtypes using transcriptomic, copy number and mutation multi-omics data. A certain number of metabolic and signalling processes specifically deregulated in each of the ovarian cancer sub-types were identified. Conclusions: As knowledge evolves and new omics data becomes more heterogeneous, gathering together existing domains of biology under common platforms is essential. We believe that an integrated ACSN-ReconMap 2.0 resource will help in understanding various disease mechanisms and discovery of new interactions at the intersection of cell signalling and metabolism. In addition, the successful integration of metabolic and signalling networks allows broader systems biology approach application for data interpretation and retrieval of intervention points to tackle simultaneously the key players coordinating signalling and metabolism in human diseases.},

abstract = {mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) integrates three major inputs—nutrients (amino acids), growth factors (insulin), and cellular energy status—to control several catabolic and anabolic processes that collectively determine cell growth and metabolism. mTOR forms two structurally and functionally distinct multiprotein complex-es, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which correspond to two major branches within the overall signaling network. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are atypical serine/threonine kinases. The main components of the network other than the mTORCs are depicted in bright yellow. In response to growth factors, AKT phosphorylates and inactivates TSC1-TSC2 (a heterodimeric GTPase-activating protein), allowing GTP-bound Rheb (a Ras-like GTPase) to activate mTORC1 and possibly mTORC2. Low energy (cel-lular energy status) inhibits mTORC by activating AMPK, which phosphorylates and activates TSC1-TSC2. The pathway by which amino acids, leucine in particular, activate mTORC1 is poorly understood. mTORC1 controls protein synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the translational inhibitor 4E-BP and by phosphorylat-ing and activating S6 kinase (S6K). S6K, in addition to phosphorylating various translational targets, also phosphorylates and inhibits insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) as part of a negative feedback loop that attenuates insulin signaling. mTORC2 promotes cell survival through direct phosphorylation of serine 473 in the hydrophobic motif of AKT. The immunosuppressant rapamycin in complex with FKBP binds and inhibits mTORC1 but not mTORC2. mTOR signaling is deregulated in many diseases including cancer and metabolic disorders. mTOR also mediates nutrient-related processes such as appetite control and aging.

Existing strategies for reducing genome-wide off-target effects of the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) are imperfect, possessing only partial or unproven efficacies and other limitations that constrain their use. Here we describe SpCas9-HF1, a high-fidelity variant harbouring alterations designed to reduce non-specific DNA contacts. SpCas9-HF1 retains on-target activities comparable to wild-type SpCas9 with {\textgreater}85{\%} of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) tested in human cells. Notably, with sgRNAs targeted to standard non-repetitive sequences, SpCas9-HF1 rendered all or nearly all off- target events undetectable by genome-wide break capture and targeted sequencing methods. Even for atypical, repetitive target sites, the vast majority of off-target mutations induced by wild-type SpCas9 were not detected with SpCas9-HF1. With its exceptional precision, SpCas9-HF1 provides an alternative to wild-type SpCas9 for research and therapeutic applications. More broadly, our results suggest a general strategy for optimizing genome-wide specificities of other CRISPR-RNA-guided nucleases.},

abstract = {HER-2/neu amplification or overexpression can make cancer cells resistant to apoptosis and promotes their growth. p53 is crucial in regulating cell growth and apoptosis, and is often mutated or deleted in many types of tumour. Moreover, many tumours with a wild-type gene for p53 do not have normal p53 function, suggesting that some oncogenic signals suppress the function of p53. In this study, we show that HER-2/neu-mediated resistance to DNA-damaging agents requires the activation of Akt, which enhances MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53. Akt physically associates with MDM2 and phosphorylates it at Ser166 and Ser186. Phosphorylation of MDM2 enhances its nuclear localization and its interaction with p300, and inhibits its interaction with p19ARF, thus increasing p53 degradation. Our study indicates that blocking the Akt pathway mediated by HER-2/neu would increase the cytotoxic effect of DNA-damaging drugs in tumour cells with wild-type p53.},

abstract = {Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays essential roles in cell proliferation, survival and metabolism by forming at least two functional distinct multi-protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. External growth signals can be received and interpreted by mTORC2 and further transduced to mTORC1. On the other hand, mTORC1 can sense inner-cellular physiological cues such as amino acids and energy states and can indirectly suppress mTORC2 activity in part through phosphorylation of its upstream adaptors, IRS-1 or Grb10, under insulin or IGF-1 stimulation conditions. To date, upstream signaling pathways governing mTORC1 activation have been studied extensively, while the mechanisms modulating mTORC2 activity remain largely elusive. We recently reported that Sin1, an essential mTORC2 subunit, was phosphorylated by either Akt or S6K in a cellular context-dependent manner. More importantly, phosphorylation of Sin1 at T86 and T398 led to a dissociation of Sin1 from the functional mTORC2 holo-enzyme, resulting in reduced Akt activity and sensitizing cells to various apoptotic challenges. Notably, an ovarian cancer patient-derived Sin1-R81T mutation abolished Sin1-T86 phosphorylation by disrupting the canonical S6K-phoshorylation motif, thereby bypassing Sin1-phosphorylation-mediated suppression of mTORC2 and leading to sustained Akt signaling to promote tumorigenesis. Our work therefore provided physiological and pathological evidence to reveal the biological significance of Sin1 phosphorylation-mediated suppression of the mTOR/Akt oncogenic signaling, and further suggested that misregulation of this process might contribute to Akt hyper-activation that is frequently observed in human cancers.},

abstract = {DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that regulate DNA topology and are essential for the integrity of the genetic material during transcription, replication and recombination processes. Inhibitors of the mammalian enzymes are widely used antitumor drugs. They stabilize topoisomerase-DNA cleavable complexes by hindering the DNA relegating step of the catalytic reaction, thus resulting in DNA cleavage stimulation. Investigations on the sequence selectivity of DNA cleavage stimulated by chemically unrelated compounds established that specific nucleotides flanking strand cuts are required for drug action. Moreover, structure-activity relationship studies have identified structural determinants of drug sequence specificities, thus eventually allowing the design of new agents targeted at selected genomic regions. The initial cellular lesion, i.e., the drug-stabilized cleavable complex, is a reversible molecular event; however, how it may lead to cell death remains to be fully clarified. Several laboratories focused in past years on molecular and genetic aspects of drug-activated apoptosis. Irreversible double-stranded DNA breaks, generated from collisions between cleavable complexes and advancing replication forks, were suggested to increase p53 protein levels, thus triggering the cell death program. Other genes were also shown to cooperate in modulating the cell response to drug treatments. Recently, several groups have evaluated the possible prognostic value of topoisomerase II levels in solid tumors and hematopoietic neoplasms. Topoisomerase II inhibitors may also have genotoxic effects. Secondary leukemias, characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 9, have been reported in disease-free patients after treatments with drug regimens that included anti-topoisomerase II agents. It has been proposed that an impairment of topoisomerase activity may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of secondary leukemias.},

The particular strengths of CellNetAnalyzer are methods for functional network analysis, i.e. for characterising functional states, for detecting functional dependencies, for identifying intervention strategies, or for giving qualitative predictions on the effects of perturbations. CellNetAnalyzer extends its predecessor FluxAnalyzer (originally developed for metabolic network and pathway analysis) by a new modelling framework for examining signal-flow networks. Two of the novel methods implemented in CellNetAnalyzer are discussed in more detail regarding algorithmic issues and applications: the computation and analysis (i) of shortest positive and shortest negative paths and circuits in interaction graphs and (ii) of minimal intervention sets in logical networks.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED The accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks from large scale molecular profile datasets represents one of the grand challenges of Systems Biology. The Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe) represents one of the most effective tools to accomplish this goal. However, the initial Fixed Bandwidth (FB) implementation is both inefficient and unable to deal with sample sets providing largely uneven coverage of the probability density space. Here, we present a completely new implementation of the algorithm, based on an Adaptive Partitioning strategy (AP) for estimating the Mutual Information. The new AP implementation (ARACNe-AP) achieves a dramatic improvement in computational performance (200× on average) over the previous methodology, while preserving the Mutual Information estimator and the Network inference accuracy of the original algorithm. Given that the previous version of ARACNe is extremely demanding, the new version of the algorithm will allow even researchers with modest computational resources to build complex regulatory networks from hundreds of gene expression profiles. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION A JAVA cross-platform command line executable of ARACNe, together with all source code and a detailed usage guide are freely available on Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/aracne-ap). JAVA version 8 or higher is required. CONTACT califano@c2b2.columbia.edu SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase-2 (RSK2) belongs to a family of growth factor-activated serine/threonine kinases composed of two kinase domains connected by a regulatory linker region. The N-terminal kinase of RSK2 is involved in substrate phosphorylation. Its activation requires phosphorylation of the linker region at Ser369, catalyzed by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and at Ser386, catalyzed by the C-terminal kinase, after its activation by ERK. In addition, the N-terminal kinase must be phosphorylated at Ser227 in the activation loop by an as yet unidentified kinase. Here, we show that the isolated N-terminal kinase of RSK2 (amino acids 1-360) is phosphorylated at Ser227 by PDK1, a constitutively active kinase, leading to 100-fold stimulation of kinase activity. In COS7 cells, ectopic PDK1 induced the phosphorylation of full-length RSK2 at Ser227and Ser386, without involvement of ERK, leading to partial activation of RSK2. Similarly, two other members of the RSK family, RSK1 and RSK3, were partially activated by PDK1 in COS7 cells. Finally, our data indicate that full activation of RSK2 by growth factor requires the cooperation of ERK and PDK1 through phosphorylation of Ser227, Ser369, and Ser386. Our study extend recent findings which implicate PDK1 in the activation of protein kinases B and C and p70S6K, suggesting that PDK1 controls several major growth factor-activated signal transduction pathways.},

However, mLST8 null embryos survive until e10.5 and resemble embryos missing rictor. mLST8 is necessary to maintain the rictor-mTOR, but not the raptor-mTOR, interaction, and both mLST8 and rictor are required for the hydrophobic motif phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and PKC alpha, but not S6K1. Furthermore, insulin signaling to FOXO3, but not to TSC2 or GSK3 beta, requires mLST8 and rictor. Thus, mTORC1 function is essential in early development, mLST8 is required only for mTORC2 signaling, and mTORC2 is a necessary component of the Akt-FOXO and PKC alpha pathways.},

Metabolites are crucial components of biological system and highly informative about its functional state, due to their closeness to functional endpoints and to the organism's phenotypes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, next to Mass Spectrometry (MS), is one of the main metabolomics analytical platforms. The technological developments in the field of NMR spectroscopy have enabled the identification and quantitative measurement of the many metabolites in a single sample of biofluids in a non-targeted and non-destructive manner. Combination of NMR spectra of biofluids and pattern recognition methods has driven forward the application of metabolomics in the field of biomarker discovery. The importance of metabolomics in diagnostics, e.g. in identifying biomarkers or defining pathological status, has been growing exponentially as evidenced by the number of published papers.

abstract = {Motivation: De novo transcriptome assembly is an integral part for many RNA-seq workflows. Common applications include sequencing of non-model organisms, cancer or meta transcriptomes. Most de novo transcriptome assemblers use the de Bruijn graph (DBG) as the underlying data structure. The quality of the assemblies produced by such assemblers is highly influenced by the exact word length k. As such no single kmer value leads to optimal results. Instead, DBGs over different kmer values are built and the assemblies are merged to improve sensitivity. However, no studies have investigated thoroughly the problem of automatically learning at which kmer value to stop the assembly. Instead a suboptimal selection of kmer values is often used in practice. Results: Here we investigate the contribution of a single kmer value in a multi-kmer based assembly approach. We find that a comparative clustering of related assemblies can be used to estimate the importance of an additional kmer assembly. Using a model fit based algorithm we predict the kmer value at which no further assemblies are necessary. Our approach is tested with different de novo assemblers for datasets with different coverage values and read lengths. Further, we suggest a simple post processing step that significantly improves the quality of multi-kmer assemblies. Conclusion: We provide an automatic method for limiting the number of kmer values without a significant loss in assembly quality but with savings in assembly time. This is a step forward to making multi-kmer methods more reliable and easier to use.},

abstract = {The signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) were originally identified in the signaling pathway activated by the nontyrosine kinase containing cytokine receptors. The role of these STATs in hematopoietic cell signaling has been well described. In the case of cytokine receptors, activation of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation occurs through ligand-induced recruitment, and activation of the intracellular JAK kinases. However, STATs can also be activated by growth factor receptors, particularly the EGFR; as well as by members of the Src Family of Kinases (SFKs), particularly c-Src. In many cases, there is a differential activation of the STATs by these tyrosine kinases as compared to activation by the cytokine receptors. This difference provides for the potential of unique actions of STATs in response to growth factor receptor and SFK activation. Since there are many cancers in which SFKs and c-Src in particular, are co-overexpressed with growth factor receptors, it is not surprising that STATs play an important role in the tumorigenesis process induced by c-Src. The activation paradigm and role of STATs in these cancers, with particular emphasis on breast cancer models, is discussed.},

abstract = {The protein diversity that exists today has resulted from various evolutionary processes. It is well known that gene duplication (GD) along with the accumulation of mutations are responsible, among other factors, for an increase in the number of different proteins. The gene structure in eukaryotes requires the removal of non-coding sequences, introns, to produce mature mRNAs. This process, known as cis-splicing, referred to here as splicing, is regulated by several factors which can lead to numerous splicing arrangements, commonly designated as alternative splicing (AS). AS, producing several transcripts isoforms form a single gene, also increases the protein diversity. However, the evolution and manner for increasing protein variation differs between AS and GD. An important question is how are patterns of AS affected after a GD event. Here, we review the current knowledge of AS and GD, focusing on their evolutionary relationship. These two processes are now considered the main contributors to the increasing protein diversity and therefore their relationship is a relevant, yet understudied, area of evolutionary study.},

abstract = {The lipase activity of most phospholipases C (PLCs) is basally repressed by a highly degenerate and mostly disordered X/Y linker inserted within the catalytic domain. Release of this auto-inhibition is driven by electrostatic repulsion between the plasma membrane and the electronegative X/Y linker. In contrast, PLC-$\gamma$ isozymes (PLC-$\gamma$1 and -$\gamma$2) are structurally distinct from other PLCs because multiple domains are present in their X/Y linker. Moreover, although many tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate PLC-$\gamma$ isozymes to enhance their lipase activity, the underlying molecular mechanism of this activation remains unclear. Here we define the mechanism for the unique regulation of PLC-$\gamma$ isozymes by their X/Y linker. Specifically, we identify the C-terminal SH2 domain within the X/Y linker as the critical determinant for auto-inhibition. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the X/Y linker mediates high affinity intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal SH2 domain that is coupled to a large conformational rearrangement and release of auto-inhibition. Consequently, PLC-$\gamma$ isozymes link phosphorylation to phospholipase activation by elaborating upon primordial regulatory mechanisms found in other PLCs.},

Advances in the speed and sensitivity of these methods have enabled improvements in temporal resolution and increased the number of compounds detectable. Similar advances have enabled improved detection at tissue samples, with a substantial emphasis on single cell and other small samples.

abstract = {We used adaptive evolution to improve freeze tolerance of industrial baker's yeast. Our hypothesis was that adaptation to low temperature is accompanied by enhanced resistance of yeast to freezing. Based on this hypothesis, yeast was propagated in a flour-free liquid dough model system, which contained sorbitol and NaCl, by successive batch refreshments maintained constantly at 12°C over at least 200 generations. Relative to the parental population, the maximal growth rate (µ(max)) under the restrictive conditions, increased gradually over the time course of the experiment. This increase was accompanied by enhanced freeze tolerance. However, these changes were not the consequence of genetic adaptation to low temperature, a fact that was confirmed by prolonged selection of yeast cells in YPD at 12°C. Instead, the experimental populations showed a progressive increase in NaCl tolerance. This phenotype was likely achieved at the expense of others traits, since evolved cells showed a ploidy reduction, a defect in the glucose derepression mechanism and a loss in their ability to utilize gluconeogenic carbon sources. We discuss the genetic flexibility of S. cerevisiae in terms of adaptation to the multiple constraints of the experimental design applied to drive adaptive evolution and the technologically advantageous phenotype of the evolved population.},

abstract = {RSK is a serine/threonine kinase containing two distinct catalytic domains. Found at the terminus of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase cascade, mitogen-stimulated ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity requires multiple inputs. These inputs include phosphorylation of the C-terminal kinase domain activation loop by ERK1/2 and phosphorylation of the N-terminal kinase domain activation loop by phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Previous work has shown that upon mitogen stimulation, RSK accumulates in the nucleus. Here we show that prior to nuclear translocation, epidermal growth factor-stimulated RSK1 transiently associates with the plasma membrane. Myristylation of wild-type RSK1 results in an activated enzyme in the absence of added growth factors. When RSK is truncated at the C terminus, the characterized ERK docking is removed and RSK phosphotransferase activity is completely abolished. When myristylated, however, this myristylated C-terminal truncated form (myrCTT) is activated at a level equivalent to myristylated wild-type (myrWT) RSK. Both myrWT RSK and myrCTT RSK can signal to the RSK substrate c-Fos in the absence of mitogen activation. Unlike myrWT RSK, myrCTT RSK is not further activated by serum. Only the myristylated RSK proteins are basally phosphorylated on avian RSK1 serine 381, a site critical for RSK activity. The myristylated and unmyristylated RSK constructs interact with PDK1 upon mitogen stimulation, and this interaction is insensitive to the MEK inhibitor UO126. Because a kinase-inactive CTT RSK can be constitutively activated by targeting to the membrane, we propose that ERK may have a dual role in early RSK activation events: preliminary phosphorylation of RSK and escorting RSK to a membrane-associated complex, where additional MEK/ERK-independent activating inputs are encountered.},

abstract = {mTOR and raptor are components of a signaling pathway that regulates mammalian cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors. Here, we identify a member of this pathway, a protein named G$\beta$L that binds to the kinase domain of mTOR and stabilizes the interaction of raptor with mTOR. Like mTOR and raptor, G$\beta$L participates in nutrient- and growth factor-mediated signaling to S6K1, a downstream effector of mTOR, and in the control of cell size. The binding of G$\beta$L to mTOR strongly stimulates the kinase activity of mTOR toward S6K1 and 4E-BP1, an effect reversed by the stable interaction of raptor with mTOR. Interestingly, nutrients and rapamycin regulate the association between mTOR and raptor only in complexes that also contain G$\beta$L. Thus, we propose that the opposing effects on mTOR activity of the G$\beta$L- and raptor-mediated interactions regulate the mTOR pathway.},

However, the phorbol ester (TPA) and EGF‐induced phosphorylation of Ser63 and Ser73 is mediated by ERK1/ERK2, as well as JNK1/JNK2, in fibroblasts from wild‐type mice and by ERK1/ERK2 alone in fibroblasts from JNK‐deficient mice. The phosphorylation of Thr239 is catalysed by GSK3 and the phosphorylation of Ser243 by an as yet unidentified protein kinase. The inhibition of GSK3 is not required for the dephosphorylation of Thr239 in response to LPS, and nor is the phosphorylation of Thr91 and Thr93 required for the TPA‐ or EGF‐induced dephosphorylation of Thr239 in fibroblasts. The agonist‐induced dephosphorylation of Thr239 may involve a conformational change that exposes Thr239 to dephosphorylation and/or the activation of a Thr239 phosphatase.},

abstract = {We present a powerful experimental-computational technology for inferring network models that predict the response of cells to perturbations, and that may be useful in the design of combinatorial therapy against cancer. The experiments are systematic series of perturbations of cancer cell lines by targeted drugs, singly or in combination. The response to perturbation is quantified in terms of relative changes in the measured levels of proteins, phospho-proteins and cellular phenotypes such as viability. Computational network models are derived de novo, i.e., without prior knowledge of signaling pathways, and are based on simple non-linear differential equations. The prohibitively large solution space of all possible network models is explored efficiently using a probabilistic algorithm, Belief Propagation (BP), which is three orders of magnitude faster than standard Monte Carlo methods. Explicit executable models are derived for a set of perturbation experiments in SKMEL-133 melanoma cell lines, which are resistant to the therapeutically important inhibitor of RAF kinase. The resulting network models reproduce and extend known pathway biology. They empower potential discoveries of new molecular interactions and predict efficacious novel drug perturbations, such as the inhibition of PLK1, which is verified experimentally. This technology is suitable for application to larger systems in diverse areas of molecular biology.},

abstract = {Cancerogenesis is driven by mutations leading to aberrant functioning of a complex network of molecular interactions and simultaneously affecting multiple cellular functions. Therefore, the successful application of bioinformatics and systems biology methods for analysis of high-throughput data in cancer research heavily depends on availability of global and detailed reconstructions of signalling networks amenable for computational analysis. We present here the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network (ACSN), an interactive and comprehensive map of molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer. The resource includes tools for map navigation, visualization and analysis of molecular data in the context of signalling network maps. Constructing and updating ACSN involves careful manual curation of molecular biology literature and participation of experts in the corresponding fields. The cancer-oriented content of ACSN is completely original and covers major mechanisms involved in cancer progression, including DNA repair, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle, EMT and cell motility. Cell signalling mechanisms are depicted in detail, together creating a seamless 'geographic-like' map of molecular interactions frequently deregulated in cancer. The map is browsable using NaviCell web interface using the Google Maps engine and semantic zooming principle. The associated web-blog provides a forum for commenting and curating the ACSN content. ACSN allows uploading heterogeneous omics data from users on top of the maps for visualization and performing functional analyses. We suggest several scenarios for ACSN application in cancer research, particularly for visualizing high-throughput data, starting from small interfering RNA-based screening results or mutation frequencies to innovative ways of exploring transcriptomes and phosphoproteomes. Integration and analysis of these data in the context of ACSN may help interpret their biological significance and formulate mechanistic hypotheses. ACSN may also support patient stratification, prediction of treatment response and resistance to cancer drugs, as well as design of novel treatment strategies.},

@article{Carriere2008,
abstract = {Background: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a Ser/Thr kinase that controls cell growth in response to mitogens, as well as amino acid and energy sufficiency. The scaffolding protein Raptor binds to mTOR and recruits substrates to the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Although Raptor has been shown to be essential for mTORC1 activity, the mechanisms regulating Raptor function remain unknown. Results: Here, we demonstrate that Raptor becomes highly phosphorylated on RXRXXpS/T consensus motifs after activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference, we show that the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) 1 and 2 are required for Raptor phosphorylation in vivo and directly phosphorylate Raptor in vitro. Quantitative mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that RSK specifically phosphorylates Raptor within an evolutionarily conserved region with no previously known function. Interestingly, expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and MEK that elevate mTORC1 activity induced strong and constitutive phosphorylation of Raptor on these residues. Importantly, we demonstrate that expression of Raptor mutants lacking RSK-dependent phosphorylation sites markedly reduced mTOR phosphotransferase activity, indicating that RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor is important for mTORC1 activation by the Ras/MAPK pathway. Conclusions: We propose a unique mode of mTOR regulation in which RSK-mediated phosphorylation of Raptor regulates mTORC1 activity and thus suggest a means by which the Ras/MAPK pathway might promote rapamycin-sensitive signaling independently of the PI3K/Akt pathway. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Biotechnology offers extensive possibilities to incorporate new traits into organisms. Genetically modified (GM) traits relevant for agro-ecosystems include traits such as pest resistance and herbicide tolerance in crop plants, increased growth rate in fish and livestock, and enhanced nitrogen-fixation capabilities of soil microbes. In this review, we evaluated the direct and indirect trait-specific effects of GM plants, microbes, and animals on ecosystem processes and found that most of the effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on ecosystem processes are indirect and are the result of associated changes in management strategy rather than a direct effect of the GMOs. Conflicting results on the performance and effects of GMOs are frequently reported, especially regarding crop yield and impacts on soil organisms. This is partly because methods with different levels of resolution have been used in different ecological contexts. Overall, there is little evidence that the effects of GM traits on ecosystem processes act with different mechanisms from those of traits modified using conventional methods. However, little is known about trait-specific effects of GMOs on ecosystem processes even though GMOs have been used for more than three decades. In particular, studies linking genetically modified traits to ecosystem processes at longer time scales are rare, but needed for evaluating trait effects, especially in an evolutionary context. In addition, biotechnology may provide a unique tool for gaining insights into the links between traits and ecosystem processes when integrated into basic ecological research.},

abstract = {Mitogen‐activated protein (MAP) kinases bind tightly to many of their physiologically relevant substrates. We have identified a new subfamily of murine serine/threonine kinases, whose members, MAP kinase‐interacting kinase 1 (Mnk1) and Mnk2, bind tightly to the growth factor‐regulated MAP kinases, Erk1 and Erk2. Mnk1, but not Mnk2, also binds strongly to the stress‐activated kinase, p38. Mnk1 complexes more strongly with inactive than active Erk, implying that Mnk and Erk may dissociate after mitogen stimulation. Erk and p38 phosphorylate Mnk1 and Mnk2, which stimulates their in vitro kinase activity toward a substrate, eukaryotic initiation factor‐4E (eIF‐4E). Initiation factor eIF‐4E is a regulatory phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation is increased by insulin in an Erk‐dependent manner. In vitro, Mnk1 rapidly phosphorylates eIF‐4E at the physiologically relevant site, Ser209. In cells, Mnk1 is post‐translationally modified and enzymatically activated in response to treatment with either peptide growth factors, phorbol esters, anisomycin or UV. Mitogen‐ and stress‐mediated Mnk1 activation is blocked by inhibitors of MAP kinase kinase 1 (Mkk1) and p38, demonstrating that Mnk1 is downstream of multiple MAP kinases. Mnk1 may define a convergence point between the growth factor‐activated and one of the stress‐activated protein kinase cascades and is a candidate to phosphorylate eIF‐4E in cells.},

Correction occurred via homology-directed repair (HDR) based on an exogenously supplied oligonucleotide or the endogenous WT allele, with only rare evidence of off-target modifications. The resulting mice were fertile and able to transmit the corrected allele to their progeny. Thus, our study provides proof of principle for use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to correct genetic disease.},

abstract = {Systems techniques are integral to current research in molecular cell biology. These systems ap- proaches stand in contrast to the historically reductionist paradigm of molecular biology. The shift toward a systems perspective was gradual; it passed a turning point at the end of the 20th cen- tury, when newly developed experimental techniques provided system-level observations of cellular networks. These observations revealed the full complexity of these networks, and made it clear that traditional (largely qualitative) molecular biology techniques are ill-equipped for the investi- gation of these systems, which often exhibit non-intuitive behaviour. This point was illustrated in a thought experiment proposed by Yuri Lazebnik (Lazebnik, 2002). He described a (failed) attempt to reverse-engineer a transistor radio using qualitative methods analogous to those used in tradi- tional molecular biology. Lazebnik's exercise demonstrates that without a quantitative framework to describe large networks of interacting components, the functioning of cellular networks cannot be resolved. A quantitative approach to molecular biology allows traditional interaction diagrams to be extended to mechanistic mathematical models. These models serve as working hypotheses: they help us to understand and predict the behaviour of complex systems. The application of mathematical modelling to molecular cell biology is not a new endeavour; there is a long history of mathematical descriptions of biochemical and genetic networks. Successful applications include Alan Turing's description of patterning in development (discussed by Murray, 2003), the models of neuronal signalling developed by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley (reviewed by Rinzel, 1990), and Denis Noble's mechanistic modelling of the heart (Noble, 2004). Despite these successes, this sort of mathematical work has not been considered central to (most of) molecular cell biology. That attitude is changing; system-level investigations are now frequently accompanied by mathematical models, and such models may soon become requisites for describing the behaviour of cellular networks.},

abstract = {Molecular biology has become heavily dependent on biological knowledge encoded in expert curated biological databases. As the volume of biological literature increases, biocurators need help in keeping up with the literature; (semi-) automated aids for biocuration would seem to be an ideal application for natural language processing and text mining. However, to date, there have been few documented successes for improving biocuration throughput using text mining. Our initial investigations took place for the workshop on 'Text Mining for the BioCuration Workflow' at the third International Biocuration Conference (Berlin, 2009). We interviewed biocurators to obtain workflows from eight biological databases. This initial study revealed high-level commonalities, including (i) selection of documents for curation; (ii) indexing of documents with biologically relevant entities (e.g. genes); and (iii) detailed curation of specific relations (e.g. interactions); however, the detailed workflows also showed many variabilities. Following the workshop, we conducted a survey of biocurators. The survey identified biocurator priorities, including the handling of full text indexed with biological entities and support for the identification and prioritization of documents for curation. It also indicated that two-thirds of the biocuration teams had experimented with text mining and almost half were using text mining at that time. Analysis of our interviews and survey provide a set of requirements for the integration of text mining into the biocuration workflow. These can guide the identification of common needs across curated databases and encourage joint experimentation involving biocurators, text mining developers and the larger biomedical research community.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Linking experimental data to mathematical models in biology is impeded by the lack of suitable software to manage and transform data. Model calibration would be facilitated and models would increase in value were it possible to preserve links to training data along with a record of all normalization, scaling, and fusion routines used to assemble the training data from primary results. RESULTS We describe the implementation of DataRail, an open source MATLAB-based toolbox that stores experimental data in flexible multi-dimensional arrays, transforms arrays so as to maximize information content, and then constructs models using internal or external tools. Data integrity is maintained via a containment hierarchy for arrays, imposition of a metadata standard based on a newly proposed MIDAS format, assignment of semantically typed universal identifiers, and implementation of a procedure for storing the history of all transformations with the array. We illustrate the utility of DataRail by processing a newly collected set of approximately 22 000 measurements of protein activities obtained from cytokine-stimulated primary and transformed human liver cells.

In this work we developed and extensively characterized an amperometric glucose microbiosensor using ceramic-based platinum multisite microelectrode arrays (MEAs) for measuring extracellular glucose in the rat brain in vivo. Glucose-oxidase (GOx) was immobilized at the microelectrode surface by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde in the presence of BSA. The in vitro evaluations supported the high analytical performance of these microbiosensors for application in the brain, including high selectivity and sensitivity, adequate linear range and limit of detection, good operational stability and response time, minimal oxygen-, pH- and temperature-dependencies. The microbiosensors were successfully used for measurements of glucose with high temporal and spatial resolution in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats in response to systemic, local glucose changes and upon glutamatergic stimulation. Overall, the results support the suitability of these microbiosensors for measuring rapid changes of extracellular glucose in the rat brain.},

abstract = {RAD51 is the central protein that catalyzes DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR), a process that ensures genomic stability. RAD51 protein is commonly expressed at high levels in cancer cells relative to their non-cancerous precursors. High levels of RAD51 expression can lead to the formation of genotoxic RAD51 protein complexes on undamaged chromatin. We developed a therapeutic approach that exploits this potentially toxic feature of malignancy, using compounds that stimulate the DNA binding activity of RAD51 to promote cancer cell death. A panel of immortalized cell lines was challenged with the RAD51-stimulatory compound RS-1. Resistance to RS-1 tended to occur in cells with higher levels of RAD54L and RAD54B, which are Swi2/Snf2-related translocases known to dissociate RAD51 filaments from double-stranded DNA. In PC3 prostate cancer cells, RS-1 induced lethality was accompanied by the formation of microscopically visible RAD51 nuclear protein foci occurring in the absence of any DNA-damaging treatment. Treatment with RS-1 promoted significant anti-tumor responses in a mouse model, providing proof of principle for this novel therapeutic strategy.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The different epidermal growth factor (EGF)-related peptides elicit a diverse array of biological responses as the result of their ability to activate distinct subsets of ErbB receptor dimers, leading to the recruitment of different intracellular signaling networks. To specifically examine dimerization-dependent modulation of receptor signaling, we constructed NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 singly and in pairwise combinations with each other ErbB family member. This model system allowed the comparison of EGF-activated ErbB-1 with ErbB-1 activated by Neu differentiation factor (NDF)-induced heterodimerization with ErbB-4. In both cases, ErbB-1 coupled to the adaptor protein Shc, but only when activated by EGF was it able to interact with Grb2. Compared to the rapid internalization of EGF-activated ErbB-1, NDF-activated ErbB-1 showed delayed internalization characteristics. Furthermore, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol kinase (PI3-K) associated with EGF-activated ErbB-1 in a biphasic manner, whereas association with ErbB-1 transactivated by ErbB-4 was monophasic. The signaling properties of ErbB-2 following heterodimerization with the other ErbB receptors or homodimerization induced by point mutation or monoclonal antibody treatment were also analyzed. ErbB-2 binding to peptides containing the Src homology 2 domain of Grb2 or p85 and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of Shc varied according to the mode of receptor activation. Finally, tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of both ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 revealed that receptor phosphorylation is dependent on the dimerization partner. Differential receptor phosphorylation may, therefore, be the basis for the differences in the signaling properties observed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Systems biology is an approach to biology that emphasizes the structure and dynamic behavior of biological systems and the interactions that occur within them. To succeed, systems biology crucially depends on the accessibility and integration of data across domains and levels of granularity. Biomedical ontologies were developed to facilitate such an integration of data and are often used to annotate biosimulation models in systems biology.RESULTS:We provide a framework to integrate representations of in silico systems biology with those of in vivo biology as described by biomedical ontologies and demonstrate this framework using the Systems Biology Markup Language. We developed the SBML Harvester software that automatically converts annotated SBML models into OWL and we apply our software to those biosimulation models that are contained in the BioModels Database. We utilize the resulting knowledge base for complex biological queries that can bridge levels of granularity, verify models based on the biological phenomenon they represent and provide a means to establish a basic qualitative layer on which to express the semantics of biosimulation models.CONCLUSIONS:We establish an information flow between biomedical ontologies and biosimulation models and we demonstrate that the integration of annotated biosimulation models and biomedical ontologies enables the verification of models as well as expressive queries. Establishing a bi-directional information flow between systems biology and biomedical ontologies has the potential to enable large-scale analyses of biological systems that span levels of granularity from molecules to organisms.},

abstract = {It has recently been shown that Ras proteins interact directly with Raf serine/threonine kinases in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system, leading to speculation that Raf proteins function as effectors for Ras. Here it is demonstrated that the endogenous Raf-1 protein co-immunoprecipitates with Ras from mammalian cells when the non-neutralizing anti-Ras monoclonal antibody Y13-238 is used. The formation of a Ras-Raf complex is absolutely dependent on prior treatment of the cells with a stimulus that activates Ras: phorbol ester or anti-T cell receptor antibody in the case of human peripheral blood T lymphoblasts, or epidermal growth factor in the case of Rat-1 fibroblasts. Up to 3{\%} of cellular Raf-1 can be found in association with Ras. The association is not competed by addition of exogenous GST-Raf to the cell lysates and is therefore unlikely to be due to Ras-Raf binding after cell lysis. Specific interaction of Ras and Raf therefore occurs in intact mammalian cells in response to stimuli that cause Ras to become GTP-bound.},

Whereas the recognition lobe is essential for binding sgRNA and DNA, the nuclease lobe contains the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains, which are properly positioned for cleavage of the complementary and noncomplementary strands of the target DNA, respectively. The nuclease lobe also contains a carboxyl-terminal domain responsible for the interaction with the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

abstract = {Cellular decisions are determined by complex molecular interaction networks. Large-scale signaling networks are currently being reconstructed, but the kinetic parameters and quantitative data that would allow for dynamic modeling are still scarce. Therefore, computational studies based upon the structure of these networks are of great interest. Here, a methodology relying on a logical formalism is applied to the functional analysis of the complex signaling network governing the activation of T cells via the T cell receptor, the CD4/CD8 co-receptors, and the accessory signaling receptor CD28. Our large-scale Boolean model, which comprises 94 nodes and 123 interactions and is based upon well-established qualitative knowledge from primary T cells, reveals important structural features (e.g., feedback loops and network-wide dependencies) and recapitulates the global behavior of this network for an array of published data on T cell activation in wild-type and knock-out conditions. More importantly, the model predicted unexpected signaling events after antibody-mediated perturbation of CD28 and after genetic knockout of the kinase Fyn that were subsequently experimentally validated. Finally, we show that the logical model reveals key elements and potential failure modes in network functioning and provides candidates for missing links. In summary, our large-scale logical model for T cell activation proved to be a promising in silico tool, and it inspires immunologists to ask new questions. We think that it holds valuable potential in foreseeing the effects of drugs and network modifications.},

Analysis of the network, which is ongoing, has already provided a clear picture of the nature and scale of the genetic interactions that robustly sustain biological systems, and how cellular buffering is achieved at the molecular level. Recent studies in yeast have begun to define general principles of genetic networks, and also pave the way for similar studies in metazoan model systems. A comparative understanding of genetic-interaction networks promises insights into some long-standing genetic problems, such as the nature of quantitative traits and the basis of complex inherited disease.},

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinases regulate cell behavior by activating specific signal transduction cascades. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor tyrosine kinases include ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4. ErbB4 is a tyrosine kinase receptor that binds neuregulins (NRG) and several other EGF family members. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis identified two isoforms of ErbB4 that differed in their cytoplasmic domain sequences. Specifically, RT-PCR using primers flanking the putative phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) binding site of ErbB4 generated two specific bands when human and mouse heart and kidney tissues were analysed. Cloning and sequencing of these RT-PCR products revealed that one of the ErbB4 isoforms (ErbB4 CYT-2) lacked a 16 amino acid sequence including a putative PI3-K binding site, that was present in the other isoform (ErbB4 CYT-1). RT-PCR analysis of mouse tissues suggested that the expression of ErbB4 CYT-1 and ErbB4 CYT-2 was tissue-specific. Heart, breast and abdominal aorta expressed predominantly ErbB4 CYT-1 whereas neural tissues and kidney expressed predominantly ErbB4 CYT-2. To ascertain whether the absence of the putative PI3-K binding site in ErbB4 CYT-2 also resulted in the loss of PI3-K activity, NIH3T3 cell lines overexpressing ErbB4 CYT-1 or ErbB4 CYT-2 were produced. NRG-1 bound to and stimulated equivalent tyrosine phosphorylation of both isoforms. However, unlike ErbB4 CYT-1, the ErbB4 CYT-2 isoform was unable to bind the p85 subunit of PI3-K and to stimulate PI3-K activity in these cells. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 or association of PI3-K activity with phosphotyrosine was not induced in NRG-1 treated cells expressing ErbB4 CYT-2, indicating that this isoform was incapable of activating PI3-K even indirectly. It was concluded that a novel naturally occurring ErbB4 isoform exists with a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain sequence required for the activation of the PI3-K intracellular signal transduction pathway and that this is the only PI3-K binding site in ErbB4.},

abstract = {Interleukin 3-dependent murine 32D cells do not detectably express members of the ErbB receptor family and do not proliferate in response to known ligands for these receptors. 32D transfectants were generated expressing human ErbB4 alone (32D.E4) or with ErbB2 (32D.E2/E4). Epidermal growth factor (EGF), neuregulin 1-beta (NRG1-beta), betacellulin (BTC), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), heparin binding-EGF (HB-EGF), and amphiregulin were analyzed for their ability to mediate mitogenesis in these transfectants. 32D.E4 responded mitogenically to NRG1-beta and BTC. Surprisingly, EGF also induced significant DNA synthesis and TGF-alpha was negligibly mitogenic on 32D.E4 cells, whereas HB-EGF and amphiregulin were inactive. Although coexpression of ErbB2 with ErbB4 in 32D.E2/E4 cells did not significantly alter DNA synthesis in response to NRG1-beta or BTC, it greatly enhanced mitogenesis elicited by EGF and TGF-alpha and unmasked the ability of HB-EGF to induce proliferation. EGF-related ligands that exhibited potent mitogenic activity on 32D.E2/E4 cells at low concentrations induced adherence, morphological alterations, and up-regulation of the Mac-1 integrin and FcgammaRII/III at higher concentrations. While 125I-EGF could be specifically crosslinked to both 32D.E4 and 32D.E2/E4 cells, its crosslinking capacity was greatly enhanced in the cotransfected cells. The ability of the various ligands to mediate proliferation and/or adhesion in the two transfectants correlated with their capacity to induce substrate tyrosine phosphorylation and to initiate and sustain activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. We conclude that the ability of ErbB4 to mediate signal transduction through EGF-like ligands is broader than previously assumed and can be profoundly altered by the concomitant expression of ErbB2.},

abstract = {Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a member of ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, is induced in a variety of stressed tissue. ATF3 regulates transcription by binding to DNA sites as a homodimer or heterodimer with Jun proteins. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression and regulation of ATF3 after axonal injury in neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord. In naive rats, ATF3 was not expressed in the DRG and spinal cord. Following the cut of peripheral nerve, ATF3 was immediately induced in virtually all DRG neurons and motoneurons that were axotomized, and the time course of induction was dependent on the distance between the injury site and the cell body. Double labeling using immunohistochemistry revealed that the population of DRG neurons expressing ATF3 included those expressing c-jun, and in motoneurons ATF3 and c-jun were concurrently expressed after axotomy. In contrast to c-jun, ATF3 was not induced transsynaptically in spinal dorsal horn neurons. We conclude that ATF3 is specifically induced in sensory and motoneurons in the spinal cord following nerve injury and should be regarded as an unique neuronal marker of nerve injury in the nervous system.},

abstract = {Although transgenic and knockout mice have helped delineate the mechanisms of action of diverse noxious compounds, it is still difficult to determine unequivocally the subpopulations of primary afferent nociceptor that these molecules engage. As most noxious stimuli lead to tissue and/or nerve injury, here we used induction of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a reliable marker of nerve injury, to assess the populations of primary afferent fibers that are activated after peripheral administration of noxious chemical stimuli. In wild-type mice, hindpaw injections of capsaicin, formalin, mustard oil or menthol induce expression of ATF3 in distinct subpopulations of sensory neurons. Interestingly, even though these noxious chemicals are thought to act through subtypes of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, all compounds also induced ATF3 in neurons that appear not to express the expected TRP channel subtypes. On the other hand, capsaicin failed to induce ATF3 in mice lacking TRPV1, indicating that TRPV1 is required for both the direct and indirect induction of ATF3 in sensory neurons. By contrast, only low doses of formalin or mustard oil failed to induce ATF3 in TRPA1 null mice, indicating that injections of high doses ({\textgreater}0.5{\%}) of formalin or mustard oil recruit both TRPA1- and non-TRPA1 expressing primary afferent fibers. Finally, peripheral injection of menthol, a TRPM8 receptor agonist, induced ATF3 in a wide variety of sensory neurons, but in a TRPM8-independent manner. We conclude that purportedly selective agonists can activate a heterogeneous population of sensory neurons, which ultimately could contribute to the behavioral responses evoked. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

ATF3 expression is stimulated by various factors such as hypoxia, cytokines, and chemotherapeutic and DNA damaging agents. Upon stimulation, ATF3 can form homodimers or heterodimers with other members of the AP-1 family to repress or activate transcription. Under physiological conditions, ATF3 expression is transient and plays a pivotal role in controlling the expression of cell-cycle regulators and tumor suppressor, DNA repair, and apoptosis genes. However, under pathological conditions such as those during breast cancer, a sustained and prolonged expression of ATF3 has been observed. In this review, the structure and function of ATF3, its posttranslational modifications (PTM), and its interacting proteins are discussed with a special emphasis on breast cancer metastasis.},

abstract = {Syndecan-4, a ubiquitous cell surface proteoglycan, mediates numerous cellular processes through signaling pathways that affect cellular proliferation, migration, mechanotransduction and endocytosis. These effects are achieved through syndecan-4 functioning as both a co-receptor for the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1-FGFR4) and its ability to independently activate signaling pathways upon ligand binding. As an FGFR co-receptor, syndecan-4 strengthens the duration and intensity of downstream signaling upon ligand binding; this is particularly evident with regard to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In contrast, syndecan-4 also functions as an independent receptor for heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). These signaling cascades affect canonical signaling components, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AKT1 and the Rho family of GTPases. In combination with the integrin family of proteins, syndecan-4 is also able to form physical connections between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cytoskeletal signaling proteins, and it has a key role in regulation of integrin turnover. This unique versatility of the interactions of syndecan-4 is characterized in this Cell Science at a Glance article and illustrated in the accompanying poster.},

abstract = {There is currently substantial interest in the regulation of cell function by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), especially effects linked to the rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Rapamycin induces G(1) arrest and blocks proliferation of many tumor cells, suggesting that the inhibition of mTORC1 signaling may be useful in cancer therapy. In MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells, rapamycin decreases levels of cyclin D1, without affecting cytoplasmic levels of its mRNA. In some cell-types, rapamycin does not affect cyclin D1 levels, whereas the starvation for leucine (which impairs mTORC1 signaling more profoundly than rapamycin) does. This pattern correlates with the behavior of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, an mTORC1 target that regulates translation initiation). siRNA-mediated knock-down of 4E-BP1 abrogates the effect of rapamycin on cyclin D1 expression and increases the polysomal association of the cyclin D1 mRNA. Our data identify 4E-BP1 as a key regulator of cyclin D1 expression, indicate that this effect is not mediated through the changes in cytoplasmic levels of cyclin D1 mRNA and suggest that, in some cell types, interfering with the amino acid input to mTORC1, rather than using rapamycin, may inhibit proliferation.},

Various mechanisms mediate the upregulation of EGFR activity, including common mutations and truncations to its extracellular domain, such as in the EGFRvIII truncations, as well as to its kinase domain, such as the L858R and T790M mutations, or the exon 19 truncation. These EGFR aberrations over-activate downstream pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK and AKT-PI3K-mTOR pathways. These pathways then activate many biological outputs that are beneficial to cancer cell proliferation, including their chronic initiation and progression through the cell cycle. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms that regulate EGFR signal transduction, including the EGFR structure and its mutations, ligand binding and EGFR dimerization, as well as the signaling pathways that lead to G1 cell cycle progression. We focus on the induction of CYCLIN D expression, CDK4/6 activation, and the repression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor proteins (CDKi) by EGFR signaling pathways. We also discuss the successes and challenges of EGFR-targeted therapies, and the potential for their use in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors.},

In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.},

abstract = {The mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways regulate cell growth, proliferation, and survival. We identify DEPTOR as an mTOR-interacting protein whose expression is negatively regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2. Loss of DEPTOR activates S6K1, Akt, and SGK1, promotes cell growth and survival, and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities. DEPTOR overexpression suppresses S6K1 but, by relieving feedback inhibition from mTORC1 to PI3K signaling, activates Akt. Consistent with many human cancers having activated mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways, DEPTOR expression is low in most cancers. Surprisingly, DEPTOR is highly overexpressed in a subset of multiple myelomas harboring cyclin D1/D3 or c-MAF/MAFB translocations. In these cells, high DEPTOR expression is necessary to maintain PI3K and Akt activation and a reduction in DEPTOR levels leads to apoptosis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural analysis of cellular interaction networks contributes to a deeper understanding of network-wide interdependencies, causal relationships, and basic functional capabilities. While the structural analysis of metabolic networks is a well-established field, similar methodologies have been scarcely developed and applied to signaling and regulatory networks. RESULTS: We propose formalisms and methods, relying on adapted and partially newly introduced approaches, which facilitate a structural analysis of signaling and regulatory networks with focus on functional aspects. We use two different formalisms to represent and analyze interaction networks: interaction graphs and (logical) interaction hypergraphs. We show that, in interaction graphs, the determination of feedback cycles and of all the signaling paths between any pair of species is equivalent to the computation of elementary modes known from metabolic networks. Knowledge on the set of signaling paths and feedback loops facilitates the computation of intervention strategies and the classification of compounds into activators, inhibitors, ambivalent factors, and non-affecting factors with respect to a certain species. In some cases, qualitative effects induced by perturbations can be unambiguously predicted from the network scheme. Interaction graphs however, are not able to capture AND relationships which do frequently occur in interaction networks. The consequent logical concatenation of all the arcs pointing into a species leads to Boolean networks. For a Boolean representation of cellular interaction networks we propose a formalism based on logical (or signed) interaction hypergraphs, which facilitates in particular a logical steady state analysis (LSSA). LSSA enables studies on the logical processing of signals and the identification of optimal intervention points (targets) in cellular networks. LSSA also reveals network regions whose parametrization and initial states are crucial for the dynamic behavior. We have implemented these methods in our software tool CellNetAnalyzer (successor of FluxAnalyzer) and illustrate their applicability using a logical model of T-Cell receptor signaling providing non-intuitive results regarding feedback loops, essential elements, and (logical) signal processing upon different stimuli. CONCLUSION: The methods and formalisms we propose herein are another step towards the comprehensive functional analysis of cellular interaction networks. Their potential, shown on a realistic T-cell signaling model, makes them a promising tool.},

Akt/PKB activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Ser473 within the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif by an unknown kinase. We show that in Drosophila and human cells the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase and its associated protein rictor are necessary for Ser473 phosphorylation and that a reduction in rictor or mammalian TOR (mTOR) expression inhibited an Akt/PKB effector. The rictor-mTOR complex directly phosphorylated Akt/PKB on Ser473 in vitro and facilitated Thr308 phosphorylation by PDK1. Rictor-mTOR may serve as a drug target in tumors that have lost the expression of PTEN, a tumor suppressor that opposes Akt/PKB activation.},

abstract = {The activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is elevated in various types of human cancers, implicating a role in tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying mTOR upregulation remain unclear. In this study, we found that the expression of mLST8, a required subunit of both mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and complex 2 (mTORC2), was upregulated in several human colon and prostate cancer cell lines and tissues. Knockdown of mLST8 significantly suppressed mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex formation, and it also inhibited tumor growth and invasiveness in human colon carcinoma (HCT116) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. Overexpression of mLST8 induced anchorage-independent cell growth in normal epithelial cells (HaCaT), although mLST8 knockdown had no effect on normal cell growth. mLST8 knockdown reduced mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT in both cancer and normal cells, whereas it potently inhibited mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 specifically in cancer cells. These results suggest that mLST8 plays distinct roles in normal and cancer cells, depending upon its expression level, and that mLST8 upregulation may contribute to tumor progression by constitutively activating both the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways.},

abstract = {The tyrosine kinase c-Src is upregulated in various human cancers, but the molecular mechanisms underlying c-Src-mediated tumor growth remain unclear. Here we examined the involvement of microRNAs in the c-Src-mediated tumor growth. Microarray profiling revealed that c-Src activation downregulates a limited set of microRNAs, including miR-99a, which targets oncogenic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Re-expression of miR-99a suppressed tumor growth of c-Src-transformed cells, and this effect was restored by the overexpression of mTOR. The downregulation of miR-99a was also observed in epidermal growth factor- and Ras-transformed cells, and it was suppressed by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, miR-99a downregulation is associated with mTOR/FGFR3 upregulation in various human lung cancer cells/tissues. The tumorigenicity of these cells was suppressed by the introduction of miR-99a. These findings suggest that the miR-99a-mTOR/FGFR3 pathway is crucial for controlling tumor growth in a wide range of human cancers that harbor upregulation of the Src-related oncogenic pathways.},

abstract = {The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that constitutes one of four members of the erbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors. Binding of EGFR to its cognate ligands leads to autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent activation of signal transduction pathways that are involved in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although present in normal cells, EGFR is overexpressed in a variety of tumor cell lines and has been associated with poor prognosis and decreased survival. EGFR activation also plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment in tumor cells. Over the past two decades, much effort has been directed at developing anticancer agents that can interfere with EGFR activity. The most common pharmacologic approaches to inhibiting EGFR have been to develop monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors. Monoclonal antibodies block ligand binding to the extracellular domain, whereas the small-molecule inhibitors exert their effects at the intracellular portion of the receptor to prevent tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and subsequent activation of signal transduction pathways. A number of EGFR inhibitors have been developed that can arrest tumor growth and, in some cases, cause tumor regression. When used in combination with cytotoxic treatments, chemotherapy, and radiation, EGFR inhibitors have been able to potentiate their anticancer activity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Woo2007,
abstract = {The protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays an important role in the coordinate regulation of cellular responses to nutritional and growth factor conditions. mTOR achieves these roles through interacting with raptor and rictor to form two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Previous studies have been focused on mTORC1 to elucidate the central roles of the complex in mediating nutritional and growth factor signals to the protein synthesis machinery. Functions of mTORC2, relative to mTORC1, have remained little understood. Here we report identification of a novel component of mTORC2 named PRR5 (PRoline-Rich protein 5), a protein encoded by a gene located on a chromosomal region frequently deleted during breast and colorectal carcinogenesis (Johnstone, C. N., Castellvi-Bel, S., Chang, L. M., Sung, R. K., Bowser, M. J., Pique, J. M., Castells, A., and Rustgi, A. K. (2005) Genomics 85, 338-351). PRR5 interacts with rictor, but not raptor, and the interaction is independent of mTOR and not disturbed under conditions that disrupt the mTOR-rictor interaction. PRR5, unlike Sin1, another component of mTORC2, is not important for the mTOR-rictor interaction and mTOR activity toward Akt phosphorylation. Despite no significant effect of PRR5 on mTORC2-mediated Akt phosphorylation, PRR5 silencing inhibits Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation and reduces cell proliferation rates, a result consistent with PRR5 roles in cell growth and tumorigenesis. The inhibition of Akt and S6K1 phosphorylation by PRR5 knock down correlates with reduction in the expression level of platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRbeta). PRR5 silencing impairs PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 and Akt but moderately reduces epidermal growth factor- and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation. These findings propose a potential role of mTORC2 in the cross-talk with the cellular machinery that regulates PDGFRbeta expression and signaling.},

abstract = {DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR) has been recently discovered as an endogenous regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1 is present in the brain, and there is growing evidence that its dysregulation contributes to several brain alterations. This suggests the involvement of mTOR signaling and its modulators in neurobiological controls. Here, we characterized and mapped the expression of DEPTOR in the rat brain. We show that DEPTOR was widely expressed from the forebrain to the hindbrain, including the hippocampus, the mediobasal hypothalamus, and the circumventricular organs (CVOs). In the hippocampus, DEPTOR protein and Deptor mRNA were highly expressed in the dendate gyrus and CA3 field. In the CVOs, DEPTOR was expressed in the subfornical organ, the median eminence, and the area postrema. In the mediobasal hypothalamus, DEPTOR was expressed in neurons of the ventromedial nucleus (VMH) and colocalized with proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). The hypothalamic distribution suggested a role for DEPTOR in energy balance. Supporting this possibility, we observed that Deptor hypothalamic expression was modulated by the nutritional status in a context of diet-induced and genetic obesity; food deprivation increased Deptor mRNA in both the ARC and VMH of obese rats. In conclusion, the present results illustrate the presence of DEPTOR in the rat brain and suggest a role for DEPTOR in the hypothalamic regulation of energy balance, which further supports the role of mTOR in energy homeostasis.

abstract = {Receptor tyrosine kinases of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family regulate essential cellular functions such as proliferation, survival, migration, and differentiation but also play central roles in the etiology and progression of tumors. We have identified short peptide sequences from a random peptide library integrated into the thioredoxin scaffold protein, which specifically bind to the intracellular domain of the EGF receptor (EGFR). These molecules have the potential to selectively inhibit specific aspects of EGF receptor signaling and might become valuable as anticancer agents. Intracellular expression of the aptamer encoding gene construct KDI1 or introduction of bacterially expressed KDI1 via a protein transduction domain into EGFR-expressing cells results in KDI1.EGF receptor complex formation, a slower proliferation, and reduced soft agar colony formation. Aptamer KDI1 did not summarily block the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity but selectively interfered with the EGF-induced phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues 845, 1068, and 1148 as well as the phosphorylation of tyrosine 317 of p46 Shc. EGF-induced phosphorylation of Stat3 at tyrosine 705 and Stat3-dependent transactivation were also impaired. Transduction of a short synthetic peptide aptamer sequence not embedded into the scaffold protein resulted in the same impairment of EGF-induced Stat3 activation.},
